1. What exactly is the life cycle of an elf? If they‚Äôre immortal and ageless, do they start from childhood and then just reach a point where they stop growing/changing? If so, shouldn‚Äôt all elves look around the same age? 

2. Considering they‚Äôre immortal, how does the ruling system work? Does a king/queen‚Äôs heir (for example, Legolas) ever actually have a chance to claim the throne? 

3. Wouldn‚Äôt the elf population just keep growing, if they never die but still reproduce? 

4. About Legolas - if he‚Äôs a prince, doesn‚Äôt that make him kind of important? I thought he was only sent to Rivendell to pass on the message about Gollum‚Äôs escape, but then he immediately agreed to travel with a group of strange people he‚Äôd never met before on an extremely dangerous quest with no protection or permission(?).

So I know that the Blu-Ray EE (Extended Editions) have a strange blue colouring in FotR, but as I know it, the DVD EE all have normal colouring. That is what I dislike about the Blu-Ray EE. 
I found out that the Blu-Ray EE are sharper (is that how you say it in English? I think you know what I mean) than the DVD theatrical releases. 
So my question is: Is the quality of the DVD EE as bad as the DVD theatrical releases or are the DVD EE as sharp (is it sharp? I mean the video quality) as the Blu-Ray EE? 

The question to those who have seen LotR on 4k: Is it really better than both other versions? (I‚Äôm just talking about the EE here) 
Are there any MAJOR issues with them so I should rather buy the other versions or are the 4k versions REALLY good in comparison to the other ones?

SO THE MAIN QUESTION IS: I really don‚Äôt care how much they cost - what version should I buy? Are the DVD versions better than the Blu-Rays because of the weird colouring? Or are the Blu-Rays better? And again to those who have seen the 4k versions: should I buy them instead, are they better than the other versions?

http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Category:Manuscripts_by_J.R.R._Tolkien

http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Index:Writings_by_J.R.R._Tolkien

Two of the more interesting items listed in my opinion are:

&gt;Note about the location of the D√∫nedain (""In January of 2000, David Salo shared the following information on the Internet: 'There is a short but hardly legible note which Tolkien wrote for insertion into the story of Aragorn and Arwen (and which was not in the event used); it includes information about the location of the Dunedain. Because of the difficulty of the note, the information is not entirely clear, but it suggests that the Dunedain lived in woodlands between the Mitheithel and Bruinen. Source: microfilms at Marquette University, Series 3, Box 9, Folder 3.'"")[4]

&gt;Essay, written in response to seeing Pauline Baynes's depiction of various characters from The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien described each member of the Fellowship of the Ring and some other persons as he pictured them ‚Äî an invaluable aid to any illustrator of his work. [Bodleian Library, Oxford: Dept. of Western Manuscripts, Mss Tolkien A61, fols. 1‚Äî31.])

see this old thread for more infomation on this essay:

https://www.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/5w9j4j/does_anyone_have_more_information_about_this/
 
Some of the other texts listed above have actually been published-either in part, or in obscure journals/fanzines etc:
 
-Some of the *The Tales And Songs of Bimble Bay* can be found in Douglas A Anderson‚Äôs *The Annotated Hobbit* (2nd edition, 2003), together with a previously unpublished poem ‚Äò‚ÄôElvish Song In Rivendell‚Äô‚Äô and a lengthy draft of *The Quest of Erebor* different to the version found in *Unfinished Tales*.
 
-The Biographical work *Tolkien and the Great War: The Threshold of Middle-earth* by John Garth (a rather excellent read in itself) publishes some of Tolkien‚Äôs earliest poems which can be found nowhere else in print.
 
-The 3rd edition of Tom Shippey‚Äôs The Road to Middle-earth (2005) reprints some of the 13 poems Tolkien initially wrote for inclusion in http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Songs_for_the_Philologists

(I'm not certain, but I think some of the other poems may have been reprinted elsewhere as well)

Tolkien was a prolific poet, some of the poems listed below have not been reprinted in many years or have only seen print in specialised journals or fanzines:

http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Mythopoeia

http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/The_Clerkes_Compleinte


Again, that isn't necessarily a complete list. The 2016 edition of *The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun* also published for the first time (or so I believe, I haven't read the book yet so can't be sure, but I have read the poem itself) several previously unknown related poems by Tolkien *The Corrigan*
 
The lists above are by no means exhaustive, ‚Äònew‚Äô writings by Tolkien continue to be published/discovered even now, and understandably much of Tolkien‚Äôs more personal and private papers remain sealed to researchers-such as his diaries, many letters and most of the manuscripts relating to his invented languages. 

The vast amount of writing relating to Tolkien's academic career remains largely unpublished, though various extracts from essays, lecture notes etc have been quoted over the years in various books.

In recent years 'extended editions' of some of Tolkien's essays have been released, incoporating previously unpublished notes, drafts and commentary by Tolkien into standalone books:

http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Beowulf_and_the_Critics

http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Tolkien_On_Fairy-stories

http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/A_Secret_Vice_(book)

The recent book by John M. Bowers *Tolkien's Lost Chaucer*, explores the development of Tolkien‚Äôs unfinished ‚ÄòClarendon Chaucer‚Äô, I haven‚Äôt actually read this book myself but as I understand Tolkien‚Äôs manuscript on Chaucer itself remains largely unpublished:
 
http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Tolkien%27s_Lost_Chaucer
 
Despite the publication in 2014 of Tolkien‚Äôs prose translation of Beowulf (*Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary
*) his alliterative translation of Beowulf remains largely unpublished (though extracts have been printed in several books).

Several years ago a collabaration between Tolkien and CS Lewis came to light:

http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Language_and_Human_Nature

-As intriguing as this project sounds, it appears that Tolkien himself had little to no direct involvement with the discovered manuscript:

http://lingwe.blogspot.com/2009/07/lewistolkien-collaboration-that-might.html

The academic journal *Tolkien Studies* publsihed annually, has re-printed various obscure (or previously unpublished writings) by Tolkien:

http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Tolkien_Studies
 
The 12 Volume *The History Of Middle Earth* series published much, but not all of the writing relating to  the textual history/development of The Silmarillion and The Lord Of The Rings. (As I recall much of the development of the *The Council Of Elrond* chapter is skipped over, as it is for *The Tale Of Aragorn and Arwen*.)
 
IIRC the HOME also doesn't cover the development of the narrative work *‚ÄòOf the Rings of Power and the Third Age‚Äô* which was published in its final form in The Silmarillion. Even in a series as large as the HOME, omissions for lack of space were needed, in his editorial commentary Christoher Tolkien often references or summarises some of the missing texts/alternate drafts which weren‚Äôt able to be included, perhaps some of these texts will be published in the forthcoming book The Nature Of Middle Earth?

(I haven't read through the H.O.M.E in several years, so no doubt there a few other relevant points I've not mentioned)

*Unfinished Tales* is similarly selective in the material it publishes (though some of the missing texe referenced by Christopher Tolkien were later published in the H.O.M.E or elsewhere)
 
The extant manuscripts for The Silmarillion and The Lord Of The Rings (not to mention The Hobbit), run to many thousands of pages each, so it is understandable that not every variant draft or related lore fragment could be published within the constraints of The H.O.M.E (though some of us no doubt feel differently!)
 
Despite the publication of the three stand alone volumes *The Children Of Hurin, Beren and Luthien, and The Fall Of Gondolin* in recent years, not all the extant material relating to these stories has been published. In the one of the links above it is noted *''The Children of Hurin. Another version of The Children of Hurin, with the same title, unpublished, is in rhyming couplets‚Äô‚Äô* similarly there is another version of the Beren and Luthien narrative  that remains unpublished (a lengthy but unfinished prose text based on *The Lay of Leithian*), as does

Tolkien scholars Wayne G Hammond and Christina Scull have published or edited numerous books about Tolkien and his writing. This includes three art books (*J. R. R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator, The Art Of The Hobbit, and The Art Of The Lord Of The Rings*) which publish much (but far from all) of Tolkien‚Äôs artwork, calligraphy, maps and illustrations, and also quote from unpublished manuscripts.

The following PDF compiled by the two is a very useful list of all of Tolkien's published art (up to July 2018): 

https://www.hammondandscull.com/addenda/Tolkien_art_list_revised_July_2018.pdf

Hammond and Scull also authored the following two books:
 
http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_A_Reader%27s_Companion
 
-The Readers Companion includes a newly transcribed version of *Nomenclature of The Lord of the Rings*, quotes from formerly unpublished parts of *""The Hunt for the Ring""* (amongst other texts) and *""Index questions""*, includes extracts from several previously unpublished letters and notes by Tolkien. Selected parts  of Tolkien‚Äôs *‚Äò'synoptic time scheme‚Äô'* are also quoted in the book, though this text itself remains largely unpublished. 
 
(During the writing of The Lord of the Rings (more so in the later stages), Tolkien found that in order to keep all of the characters' movements synchronized with travel distances, the correct day of the week  etc he had to come up with a 'synoptic' time-scheme (or to put it more simply a ‚ÄòChronology Of The Lord Of the Rings‚Äô). As I understand it this document takes the form of a series of multiple columns, it relates in brief what each character was doing that particular day, and includes some unpublished detail on what the various characters were doing on particular days ‚Äòoffscreen‚Äô (well, off-page) (e.g IIRC in the *Readers Companion* extracts from this time scheme confirm it was Bill Ferny and co who ransacked the Hobbits rooms in Bree, rather than the Ringwraiths as often supposed)
 
http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/The_J.R.R._Tolkien_Companion_and_Guide
 
-The Companion And Guide publishes for the first time a huge variety of unpublished writings (including extracts from Tolkien's diaries, unpublished lecture notes and letters, private correspodence with his publishers and the following essays):
 
http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Lecture_on_Dragons
 
http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/The_Goths
 
http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/On_the_translation_of_poetry
 
In this book Hammond and Scull note that as of 2006 (a much revised and expanded edition of the *Companion And Guide* was released in 2017) more than 1,500 Letters by J.R.R Tolkien were known to exist with more continuing to come to light each year, some of the unpublished letters are listed here:
 
http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Letters_not_published_in_%22The_Letters_of_J.R.R._Tolkien%22

The book *Letters Of J.R.R Tolkien* (first published in 1981), quotes from 354 letters or unsent drafts (only some of which are printed in full), in the decades since the book was first published many other letters have been published or quoted in part, in journals, fanzines and other books (including the aforementioned *Companion And Guide*) etc. 

Hammond and Scull have indicated on several occasions they would be interested in editing an expanded 2nd edition of The Letters Of JRR Tolkien. As a comparison a quick google shows that the *Collected Letters Of CS Lewis* runs to three(?) volumes and over 4,000 pages in length!

Hammond and Scull also edited stand alone editions of Tolkien's shorter fiction *Roverandom* (1998, 2nd edition 2013), *Farmer Giles Of Ham* (1999, 2nd edition 2014) and *The Adventures Of Tom Bombadil* (2014), these all include  previously unpublished material (e.g extracts from earlier drafts, letters, unpublished notes etc).

In 2005 Verlyn Flieger edited an 'extended edition' of *Smith Of Wooton Major* (a revised 2nd editon followed in 2015): 

http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Smith_of_Wootton_Major

&gt;In addition to editorial Notes and Commentary, the edition includes much material that was hitherto unpublished, including facsimiles of manuscripts and typescripts of previous versions, a Time Scheme, new essays (especially one dealing with the background of the story and the nature of Faerie) and notes by J.R.R. Tolkien, and a list of characters.[2]

&gt;On 26 February 2015, the extended edition was reissued by HarperCollins as a pocket hardback, with an additional gallery displaying the illustrations redrawn by Pauline Baynes for appearance in the 1980 deluxe edition of Poems and Stories.[3]

Flieger's own books on Tolkien are highly acclaimed (though I haven't read any of them myself), and I believe also quote from unpublished writing:

The BBC Written Archives Centre (Reading),  Bodleian Library (Oxford), Leeds University (England), Marquette University (Milwaukee) and Marion E. Wade Center (Wheaton College, Illinois), amongts other locations, maintain sizeable collections of Tolkien's manuscripts, correspondence etc, some of which is unpublished.

The following books also print previously unpublished material (though I've not read any of these books myself...I'm noticing a pattern here...so many books to read but so little spare time/budget...)

The forthcoming book *The Nature Of Middle-earth* (due for release in June 2021) will publish for the first time various previously unseen writings, according to its amazon.uk listing:

&gt;First ever publication of J.R.R. Tolkien‚Äôs final writings on Middle-earth, covering a wide range of subjects and perfect for those who have read and enjoyed The Silmarillion, The Lord of the Rings, Unfinished Tales, and The History of Middle-earth, and want to learn more about Tolkien‚Äôs magnificent world.

&gt;It is well known that J.R.R. Tolkien published The Hobbit in 1937 and The Lord of the Rings in 1954‚Äì5. What may be less known is that he continued to write about Middle-earth in the decades that followed, right up until the years before his death in 1973.

&gt;For him, Middle-earth was part of an entire world to be explored, and the writings in The Nature of Middle-earth reveal the journeys that he took as he sought to better understand his unique creation. From sweeping themes as profound as Elvish immortality and reincarnation, and the Powers of the Valar, to the more earth-bound subjects of the lands and beasts of N√∫menor, the geography of the Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor, and even who had beards!

The editor of the book Carl F. Hostetter has for many years acted as head of the Elvish Linguistic Fellowship (a organization devoted to the scholarly study of Tolkien‚Äôs invented languages), and has frequently edited issues of 
 
http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Vinyar_Tengwar
 
http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Parma_Eldalamberon
 
These journals are largely focussed on publishing prevously unseen manuscripts and texts relating to Tolkien‚Äôs invented languages, a still ongoing process (This particular area of Tolkien's writing is not something i have much knowledte about, so I couldn't say how extensive the relevant manuscript material is, nor how far along they are in publishing this material), see this old thread for infomation on one of the more notable unpublished texts:

https://www.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/28izi3/an_update_on_taliska_by_the_editor_vinyar_tengwar/

Although most of the writings published in these journals are linguistic and rather fragmentary in nature, more lengthy texts published include:

http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/%C3%93sanwe-kenta
 
Perhaps its possible some of this content will be republished in The Nature Of Middle-earth?

Going back to my early comments on the HOME, this old, but interesting thread from the ‚ÄòHall Of Fire‚Äô forum is particularly relevant:
 
http://www.thehalloffire.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=2250&amp;sid=9068906c31575be87382b7338147e0e3

&gt;In my Foreword to The Peoples of Middle-earth, pp.ix-x, I referred to the forerunner of the History as 'an entirely ""private"" study, without thought or purpose of publication: an exhaustive investigation and analysis of all the materials concerned with what came to be called the Elder Days, from the earliest beginnings, omitting no detail of name-form or textual variation.' This work, which I called The History of the Silmarillion, and which I began after the publication of my 'constructed' text, runs to more than 2600 very closely typed pages, and it does not even touch on the Second and Third Ages. When the possibility arose of publishing at least part of this work, in some form, it was obvious that it would have to be heavily reduced and curtailed, and the part of The History of Middle-earth dealing with the Elder Days is indeed a new presentation of The History of the Silmarillion, and a severe contraction of it, especially in respect of the sheer quantity of variant manuscript material reproduced in full.

(Aelfwine is the online name of Carl Hostetter)

See also this recent thread on the tolkienforum:

https://www.thetolkienforum.com/threads/orc-women.28932/page-2

&gt;...There are also some unpublished materials that Tolkien wrote on this subject that will not see the light of day for several decades, as both JRRT and CJRT did not want them exposed (Tolkien felt ashamed that he had even contemplated their contents). I have seen one of these in 1982, just prior to Christopher Tolkien taking possession of the entirety of the Bodleian Library‚Äôs collection of JRRT‚Äôs writings for the First/Second Ages. It is very likely that collectively these could answer more definitively the issue of ‚ÄúWhat are Orcs?‚Äù despite none of these essays themselves reaching a firm conclusion...

On the subject of Orc Women see the infamous 'Munby Letter':

Aragon‚Äôs love interest already has a history with him, allowing the relationship to not feel sudden and as if it were advancing too quickly, but rather something that Aragon commonly just looks back on.

Sitting over her son a mother and queen smiled at the boy beginning her tale, ""In the Years of the Trees, there was a Lady of Fire, Arien who's eyes burned so bright that even the Eldar could not meet her gaze. She served Vana the Queen of Flowers and in service to her she tended to her golden flower gardens, watering them with the bright dews collected by the golden tree, Laurelin. When Morgoth, whose true name is lost to our people, attempted to corrupt and ravish her she replied with fire. Burning too bright and hot for even Morgoth she burned the evil lord to char. Later, when Morgoth and Ungoliant a giant spider, destroyed the two trees Arien offered her service to carry the last fruit of Laurelin. To this day she dutifully carries the sun on it's path bathing us in it's light. Rewarding her for her loyalty and devotion, the Father of All himself created our people, the Solerin, in her image and our companions the Dragons.""

The prince smiled as she continued, ""For a time we prospered. With our affinity for fire magic and our loyal companions the dragons we built a great fortress of black stone, Ar Nar. For two generations we prospered under the light of our maiden but soon that changed.""

""What happened?"" The boy asked curiously.

The queen frowned grimly, ""Infirious, the third King Under the Sun, believed the dragons should belong to the royal family alone so he sought out Morgoth who promised Infirious that the dragons would be loyal to only one. Morgoth tricked the king and corrupted the dragons with Infirious' greed and lust for power. He blackened their once bright hearts turned them against their allies. We were forced away from our homeland and driven far east.""

""What happened next?"" He asked scared.

""At our lowest point, we believed we have been abandoned by Father of All and the Maiden of the Sun believing that we were punished for the sins of our king. We all lost hope but our prince Solarion, your father, remained hopeful that our prayers will be answered. His faith was answered when a single drop of sunlight dropped down from the sky. We trekked seven days and seven nights before we came upon a golden tree standing high within the Red Mountains. There we made a new settlement, Sel Nu and we have remained here since the First Age."" She smiled.

""Will the dragons ever be free of their curse?"" The young prince asked.

""No one knows Solvurr. All we have can do is have hope that one day the light of the sun will touch their hearts."" She replied before leaning down and kissing his brow, ""Now get some rest.""

Frodo who has a vision about what the ring would do to him if he kept it instead of destroying it and how he starts looning like gollum, this scene was definitely filmed as there are some photos online from frodo looning gollumish.

There was also a fight scene filmed with eowyn in the caves of helms deep, in which she defends the woman and children in the caves while they are possibly fleeing or something. i think that this also might get added.

I also know that there was a fight scene filmed after the fellowship makes it out of Maria. They got chased by goblins and they took these out with the help of some elfs.

206,lotr,"(Correct me if im wrong)Gandalf is a Maiar, so he was given human form to come to middle earth but he's basically an ethereal being, so his spirit went back to Valinor.  


If thats the case, the body is just a vessel and when he dies his ""spirit"" goes back and leaves the body behind. That seems reasonable to me. So this brings up a few questions:  


1. Narya: he was wearing the ring when he died, and he gets the ring back when he returns to middle earth. Either he shouldn't have the ring unless there is a section not in the book where he goes back to the mountain to get the ring before regrouping with everyone(most likely but I feel like it would have been addressed), or the ring is able to be teleported to his new body, likely by returning to Valinor with it, and then coming back to middle earth without ever losing the ring. If this is the case though, why not bring the one ring to Valinor?
2. Gandalf was obviously allowed to come back to finish the task, and since he was the only one still on task it grants him the opportunity to return. I don't think this would happen with Saruman since he tried joining forces with Sauron. Do you think he would have infinite lives? It wouldn't be the ""best"" but he could virtually end world hunger by just coming back and dying. He could basically be Jesus(not like there wasn't already subtext)

"" Far, far below the deepest delving of the Dwarves, the world is gnawed by nameless things. Even Sauron knows them not. They are older than he. Now I have walked there, but I will bring no report to darken the light of day. In that despair my enemy was my only hope, and I pursued him, clutching at his heel.""

So what Gandalf seems to be saying is that these extremely deep places of the world are either so disturbing, or contain creatures that are so terrifying, that he saw the Balrog as his hope to escape the place, and clung to the Balrog to do so. Now pretty needless to say, if you're following a Balrog in order to escape something it has to be pretty damn terrifying, right? Do we have any hints at what's going on down there? Are there a bunch of other Ungoliant-type creatures that nobody has ever even discovered?

It is obvious that the wizard is afraid of its corrupting power, and for good reason. Some might believe that he is scared of losing himself to the ring(as everyone did), but it is not his own life he is worried about. In fact, he is far more concerned about Middle-earth itself I supose.

Gandalf is such a powerful being that if he gains possession of the *One Ring*, he could easily become far stronger than Sauron &lt;by asumption&gt; and use this newfound strength to overthrow him. However, that will not be good news, because the ring will corrupt him and make him just as evil as his predecessor, no matter does he like it or not.

Now, what do you think about this theory? How do you see things from this perspective?

***Journey to the West*** ([Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters): Ë•øÈÅäË®ò; [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin): *Xƒ´ Y√≥u J√¨*) is a Chinese novel published in the 16th century during the [Ming dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty) and attributed to [Wu Cheng'en](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Cheng%27en). It is one of the [Four Great Classical Novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Chinese_Novels) of [Chinese literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_literature). It has been described as arguably the most popular literary work in East Asia.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West#cite_note-2) [Arthur Waley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Waley)'s abridged translation, [*Monkey*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_(novel)), is known in English-speaking countries.

The novel is an extended account of the legendary pilgrimage of the [Tang dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_dynasty) [Buddhist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism) monk [Xuanzang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuanzang) who travelled to the ""[Western Regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Regions),"" that is, [Central Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia) and the [Indian subcontinent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent), to obtain Buddhist sacred texts ([s≈´tras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C5%ABtra)) and returned after many trials and much suffering. It retains the broad outline of Xuanzang's own account, [*Great Tang Records on the Western Regions*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Tang_Records_on_the_Western_Regions), but the Ming dynasty novel adds elements from folk tales and the author's invention, that is, that [Gautama Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha) gave this task to the monk (referred to as [Tang Sanzang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_Sanzang) in the novel) and provided him with three protectors who agree to help him as an atonement for their sins. These disciples are [Sun Wukong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Wukong), [Zhu Bajie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhu_Bajie) and [Sha Wujing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha_Wujing), together with a dragon prince who acts as Tang Sanzang's steed, a white horse.

*Journey to the West* has strong roots in [Chinese folk religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_folk_religion), [Chinese mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_mythology), [Confucianist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism), [Taoist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism) and [Buddhist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism) philosophy, and the pantheon of [Taoist immortals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoist_immortals) and Buddhist [bodhisattvas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva) are still reflective of some Chinese religious attitudes today. Enduringly popular,[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West#cite_note-3) the novel is at once a comic adventure story, a humorous [satire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire) of Chinese bureaucracy, a source of spiritual insight, and an extended [allegory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory) in which the group of pilgrims journeys towards enlightenment by the power and virtue of cooperation.","discussion tread , what if peter jackson directed the original ""journey to the west "" book in lotr style"

I was personally thinking The Hobbit 1, 2 and 3 first, and then the LotR trilogy, as the Hobbit (to my memory) is a bit more warm and joyous than the latter.

I didn‚Äôt really expect her to pay attention (thinking she would probably end up on her phone), otherwise I probably would‚Äôve went with the theatrical versions for the easier watch, but she actually started watching pretty intently after a while, even with the longer runtimes. I made sure to answer any questions she had, explained things I thought she might‚Äôve forgotten along the way or not understood, and overall she seemed to actually enjoy it!

I loved seeing her reactions to certain parts since they were all new to her... she would comment how intense the battle of Helms Deep was, how she felt bad for Sm√©agol, how she liked Sam‚Äôs loyalty, and how well Gimli and Legolas‚Äô friendship was built. All she knew going into it was that some creature called the ring ‚Äúmy precious‚Äù, and by the end she said she almost felt sad it was over and that she was glad she‚Äôd watched it.

After being a fan for a while now, I knew how good Tolkien‚Äôs storytelling was, and also how well Peter Jackson had done from a filmmaking perspective, but getting to see someone exposed to it for the first time without much prior knowledge was really cool and interesting to see.

Now we‚Äôve started The Hobbit trilogy, and while it‚Äôs usually agreed that they‚Äôre not perfect or even close to what the LOTR achieved, I‚Äôm interested to see her reactions and glad to watch more from Middle Earth!",My mom‚Äôs reaction to these movies really reminded me how great/well-made these storylines are... even to newcomers!

566,lotr,"I don't care if this post goes unnoticed, I just want to finally share my opinion. 

I know it's been like 6 years now since the last movie but I just rewatched the trilogies last week and I thought I'd share my opinion since I've never shared it before. I have lost count of the times I've watched the Hobbit trilogy. I know the Hobbit is not liked and even hated amongst the LOTR community but I prefer the Hobbit trilogy over the LOTR trilogy :D Please don't kill me.

The reason I have only watched LOTR twice and I basically have to force myself to finish it is because of Frodo, Sam and the other two Hobbits. They are the most annoying and useless characters ever... The faces Frodo makes and the amount of time the Hobbits fuck up... jeez... If it was not for these 4 Hobbits specifically Frodo I'd watch the movies without a problem. Everything in LOTR expect for the Frodo scenes are awesome. Gimli and Legolas are the best thing in LOTR, but sadly Frodo prevents me from enjoying the movies...

Now the Hobbit movies. The best thing about them and the main reason I keep going back to them is the Soundtrack and some of the characters. Bilbo, Balin and Thorin are just awesome. Honestly, I could not care less for the rest of the Dwarfs, Laketown and even the Orcs. The Soundtrack is one of the best ever. Also, scenes like the funeral of Thorin are so emotional. You spend almost 10 hours in that universe with those characters and that scene hits you hard. The funeral song also helps me cry lol. 

I want you to picture yourself at home on your couch or bed, surrounded by blankets with your SO or friends, eating a pizza, while watching your favourite series of movies. Can you imagine the feeling you would feel? The cosiness and warmth? The Hobbit trilogy gives me that for some reason. Whenever the ""main"" song of the dwarfs starts playing I can't help but smile and mumble the notes along the epicness of the score. When I hear the dwarfs singing ""The Misty Mountains Cold"" I can't help but sing along and I get shivers every time. Every time I see the funeral scene and the scene where Bilbo says goodbye to the Dwarfs I can't help but cry. 

Yes, the movies are not perfect, far far from it. The love triangle, Laketown and a lot more could have been cut. The second movie has the name ""Smaug"" in the title but Smaug is but a small detail in the movie. I don't mind the CGI Orcs but honestly, they are still forgetful. I could go on and on but you all know the flaws.

I honestly love the Hobbit movies despite all its flaws.

I found it surprisingly moving, especially the two final stanzas. I thought I'd share them with you.

‚ÄúI will not walk with your progressive apes,
erect and sapient. Before them gapes
the dark abyss to which their progress tends
if by God‚Äôs mercy progress ever ends,
and does not ceaselessly revolve the same
unfruitful course with changing of a name.
I will not treat your dusty path and flat,
denoting this and that by this and that,
your world immutable wherein no part
the little maker has with maker‚Äôs art.
I bow not yet before the Iron Crown,
nor cast my own small golden sceptre down.

In Paradise perchance the eye may stray
from gazing upon everlasting Day
to see the day illumined, and renew
from mirrored truth the likeness of the True.
Then looking on the Blessed Land ‚Äôtwill see
that all is as it is, and yet made free:
Salvation changes not, nor yet destroys,
garden nor gardener, children nor their toys.
Evil it will not see, for evil lies
not in God‚Äôs picture but in crooked eyes,
not in the source but in malicious choice,
and not in sound but in the tuneless voice.
In Paradise they look no more awry;
and though they make anew, they make no lie.
Be sure they still will make, not being dead,
and poets shall have flames upon their head,
and harps whereon their faultless fingers fall:
there each shall choose for ever from the All.‚Äú

What a special gift Tolkien had. Truly his works were, and are, more than simply imaginary stories of made up places and people. They are invitations to see beyond the pale machinations of our everyday reality to see the beauty and goodness which God has woven into the fabric of creation itself. No wonder there is such profound gravitas and purpose to his writing.

But the last scene where they are realising Frodo is leaving, and Frodo is saying goodbye to Sam. It gets me. Now that I'm writing this, I almost tear up. Its so insane Frodo can make himself leave Sam. After all they've been together and what Sam did for Frodo. Frodo knows Sam will have a good time in the Shire, but he won't. They have to split. It's so wrecking. The scene where you see Sam walking home, without Frodo by his side. It hits hard. Sam is probably the most loyal friend ever seen. It makes me think of the time where I will have to say goodbye to my loved ones. It will be so hard for me, knowing life goes on, and there's nothing I can do about it. I will just have to live life as it has always been, just like Sam has to. There is just that difference, that the person you have been with for so long and through so much is gone. 


I love Sam, I love that scene. I think it's the best scene in a movie ever. A thing that makes it even stronger, is that it's the ending of about 10 hours of watching time.

598,lotr,"Happy belated New Year, everyone! I just wanted to celebrate completing LOTR for the first time and reflect a little on the journey. Here are a few of my thoughts after spending a year reading it. 

1. I'm somewhat glad that I took quite awhile to read this book. I read at a leisurely pace and wouldn't have wanted it any other way. Reading LOTR gave me a lot of hope and comfort during the past year. 
2. I understand why people may thoroughly enjoy reading the books, or why others may not. From opening with what effectively is an appendix (and closing with six more), to many passages of walking describing the landscape, to the endless names and dizzying amount of locations, to some of the book structure, I can see how reading Tolkien can become a little bit of a chore. I personally enjoyed the walking sections (I enjoy descriptions, I guess that comes from loving Dickens as assigned reading way back in high school), but struggled to finish some of the appendices. Yet I finished even the drier passages with some renewed strength after pondering the fact that LOTR wouldn't have been a thing without Tolkien's love for language. 
3. To both my benefit and inconvenience, the movies would not quite leave my imagination. At times, they would act as a welcome addition, with little in contrary to the book. Many of the beautiful landscapes from the movie fit perfectly, or using the voices of the movie actors helped give characters stronger identities. But after watching the movies many times over, there were a few descriptions that I couldn't get out of my head, even when Tolkien wrote contrary to the cinematic portrayal. For example, Gollum is described as dark, not pale like the movie suggests. Or how one of the appendices notes the family of Boromir, Faramir, and Denethor all shared dark hair and resembled each other greatly, contrary to the reddish hair that Sean Bean dons as Boromir. Sean Bean's portrayal won over my imagination in the end. 
4. The Two Towers was the quickest read- I committed to I focusing on it, and finished it in a month.
5. I tried reading this in middle school and nearly finished it. Yet now as an adult, I realize there were so many passages I plainly did not fully comprehend, appreciate, possess the patience to stew over, or a combination of the three. I cannot wait to reread some other books with my perspective as an adult. 
6. On that note, I savored many of the verses and songs. My personal favorite was Bilbo's song in the chapter ""The Ring Goes South"". My favorite lines are:

&gt;For still there are so many things  
&gt;  
&gt;that I have never seen;  
&gt;  
&gt;in every wood in every spring  
&gt;  
&gt;there is a different green.

Well, that's all I have for now. If you have only seen the movies (and enjoyed them), I would recommend reading LOTR \[see point 1 again :D\] . If you have already read it, I'd love to hear about your perspective!

P.S.- I posted this on the r/books sub as well. I am curious to read the different discussions from r/books and r/lotr !","It took me a year to finish the story (and a few days extra for the appendices), but I finally completed The Lord of the Rings- here are a few of my (Spoiler Free) takeaways!"

649,lotr,"Hoping for one of you experts to help me see what I‚Äôm missing. 

I was thinking the other day that all of the qualities that are deemed worthy in men are simply elf-like. 

The finest examples of the world of men - Elendil, Aragorn, even Faramir, are all praised for wisdom, nobility and even their height and long lives. 

Obviously this is because these particular men are of Elvish descent but it stands to reason, if all the best examples of men are just like Elves, what does that mean for the race as a whole? 

The same could be said for any other race, the hobbits and their courage, willpower or connection to the earth and growing things - all traits seen in the elves. 

The dwarves with their affinity for craftsmanship - eleven blades are the finest around. 

Is it *supposed* to be that the elves are this sort of √úbermensch and all other races can only achieve greatness in matching them in one of their many fantastic qualities? 

Do the Elves have any discernible flaws wherein another race actually excels? Or are there some things that other races can do better, or did first? 

*As a disclaimer, I love all the races and characters in these books, I wouldn‚Äôt change the world or history in any way, I don‚Äôt see something wrong with the way Tolkien wrote these peoples into existence, i‚Äôm more asking the above as a general discussion for fun, not pointing out something I think is bad.*",Do other races have value in comparison to the Elves?

731,lotr,,Arwen and grandma Galadriel
732,lotr,"I‚Äôm 36 years old. I‚Äôve read the LotR trilogy, The Hobbit, and in my teenage years, the Silmarillion (although I can‚Äôt say I made heads or tails of most of it). I‚Äôve loved the works of J.R.R. Tolkien from very early on. I‚Äôm by no means an expert or scholar on the subject of Middle Earth, but that hasn‚Äôt slaked my thirst or appreciation for the world this incredible man created. I sometimes forget how incredibly deep my appreciation for the lore of Tolkien‚Äôs world goes. I was a sophomore in High School when The Fellowship of the Ring was released in theaters. I remember the transcendent experience of watching this film in a dark theater, my friends and family close around. It was like nothing I‚Äôve ever experienced in my life. It was a manifestation of an incredibly rich story and mythology rendered beautifully on an adjacent but equal plain. There was a kinship and artistic vision demonstrated that couldn‚Äôt be more different from, but whole-heartedly adherent to, Tolkien‚Äôs inspired work. That was the clincher; that‚Äôs what completely committed me to the theatrical trilogy without even having viewed the last two thirds of the whole. I knew, with out a doubt, that this would be seen through to the end in true fashion. Faithful to the thrust of what Tolkien meant to impart, but interpreted through the eyes of some of his most adherent fans, creative and talented minds our earth had to offer. The trilogy would culminate in my senior year of high school; December, 2003. I vividly remember skipping class and joining my mom and dad in a long line wrapped around the theater; a group of close friends in toe to witness an end to one of the most perfect trilogies ever committed to film. (The Two Towers premier is one of my fondest. I‚Äôll always remember imbibing a large quantity of weed with my best friends before witnessing Gandalf relegate a Balrog to the watery depths of Moria and beyond. ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. This was epic in every way. How could this drama ever be matched?)

I‚Äôve recently rewatched the extended trilogy through my 55-inch Panasonic plasma TV; its 1080 P baseline clarity hardly worthy of the majesty of the magic gracing its pixels (by current technological standards). Even so, I was struck by the trilogy‚Äôs consistency and tonal impact. These films are a true masterpiece in every sense of the word. From direction to production, from cast to crew, this is monumental film-making. Even measured against recent blockbusters such as Marvel‚Äôs Infinity War and Endgame ‚Äì both films I‚Äôm a huge fan of by the way ‚Äì there is something about the measured tone of the LotR trilogy that cannot be matched. These films are a triad; but also a singular triumph of creative output and perseverance. Their existence is a miracle. Their production sequential but seemingly monolithic in terms of spectacle, special effects, and awe-inducing scale.

There are triads to be drawn from many aspects of this material. I‚Äôm not a scholar when it comes to both Earth and Middle Earth, as I‚Äôve said, but there are parallels to be connected. For me, three books, three films, three relatively arbitrary but formative sequences of years that imprint themselves indelibly into my character. High school is many things to many people, but I‚Äôm glad that these films were part of the small stones that formed my foundation as a person. Stones not even wholly concrete or truly measured, but always there. Some noble aspiration that won‚Äôt ever be matched or fulfilled. That‚Äôs what these books and films represent, a space that traditional practitioners may have reserved for biblical or religious dogmas. For me, for better or worse, resides the Tolkien triads.

Men, Elves and Dwarves; one triadic set. These races form one of the ensembles central to our story. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli; duty, wisdom and cheer, each fostering the best in each other as they make a desperate search for their abducted allies. The pillars of the story of the Ring in the third age; Merry and Pippin for one, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli for another, Frodo, Sam and Sm√©agol for a third. These groups all have their part to play in the wider tale, not to diminish the myriad supporting characters who inevitably assist our heroes in their quest and shine in their respective feats. Sunrise, sunset and twilight are heavily present in Tolkien‚Äôs series. Waxing moons and waning suns clue us into the passing days, weeks, and months of Middle Earth. There are also good, evil and neutral players as expressed through opponents of Sauron. Benign forces that would otherwise be ignorant of his schemes, Ents are neutrals in this triad. Only, in time, to be swayed and brought to bare against a small component of Sauron‚Äôs fledgling subterfuge. Saruman is eventually overthrown by an underestimated component of worldly existence. A wise, timeless, but timely metaphor for those who bare ill will to a larger holistic society.

I could go on, naming superficial or tangential components of Tolkien‚Äôs classic stories and relating or attributing them to a complicated real world, but that‚Äôs for more intelligent persons to describe and define. I love this world, though I‚Äôll never truly understand it in its entirety. I love specifically this place on the gosh-damn internet, where I can revel in appreciation for the worlds built by a genius whose works I‚Äôve so inadequately and clumsily attempted to define in the preceding lines. I love you all as extensions of Tolkien‚Äôs grand work and most importantly, just as ordinary humans like me. I know the impact these stories have had on you, no matter how deeply or superficially you may deem it. You wouldn‚Äôt be reading this if that weren‚Äôt true. Please take care of each other wherever and whenever the opportunity presents itself, and know that there are incredible numbers of Tolkien lovers out there that you may encounter without even being aware. Here‚Äôs what I say, my dear Hobbitses, be at peace‚Ä¶‚ÄùI am going now. I bid you all a very fond farewell. Goodbye.""",The Lord of the Rings &amp; The Triad of Being

They  are by far the most popular fantasy race. There are thousands of books  about them, hundreds of comics and hundreds of videogames dedicated to  them, not to mention that they have main roles in all the existing  fantasy settings (warhammer, warcraft, lotr, dnd,...) and they have one  of the most popular videogames of all times dwarffortress.

There  is no other fictionnal race that can come close to them in term of  popularity, even orcs and vampires are far behind and elves who only  exist in porns, they don't have a single videogame about them nor any  comic, just a few books where they are slaves or beggars and are hated  by all.

But what makes the dwarves  so popular? Why do thousands of people make stuff about them like this?  What do they have that other fictonnal races do not? and finally why is  nobody complaining that they have been overused (because this is  definitely the case)?",Why are the dwarves so popular?

Haven't found anything on this subreddit concerning the quality of the third movie so here I am.   


I've noticed that at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, as king Theoden instructs his men for the coming battle, that for a brief moment the sound gets wacky. It happens twice, the first one is after   
""Eomer. Take your √àored down the left flank"" Eomers response can barely be heard  


The second time it happens when Theoden says "" Grimbold, take your company right, after you pass the wall. Forth, and fear no darkness"" during that one Theoden goes basically silent mid sentence after ""fear""  


Which pisses me off. A lot. I've compared the english and german version and it happens during the same scenes, does anybody else who bought the 4K version have the same issue?

So some background, this year has beaten me, stepped on me, and at the end it spat on me, just to give me the greatest gift of all in the end.

In April I lost my job as an airline pilot due to bankrupcy. This was my dream job and I had been studying and working for years and now I finally ended up at my home country to have it ripped from my hands due to the Covid outbreak (I know many have suffered more but still). This was followed by me being rejected to job after job, failing to be accepted for a flight instructor education and finally ending up applying to the military.

I aced all the tests to end up at the doctor saying I had a sound coming from my heart that had to be examined in order for me to be accepted. (To the story is that I have been doing very strict medical examinations for many years and I believed I was perfectly healthy).

This escalated and five weeks ago I had open heart surgery to fix a hole 4x4 cm (yes CM) in my heart. I will never be a military pilot, I will probably be able to fly again once I am through this. But it gave me a normal lifespan.

Jump to today, and here I am sitting watching the end of the third movie, my chestbone still held together by steel thread, when it hit me. I have been feeling sadder and sadder lately (after the surgery) while I should just be happy I got this fixed. In the end Frodo finishes his book and talks about how one can move on, how all this can be done for good but the wound is still there. Thats when I realised. I had survived this year on anger and motivation to end up facing what could have been my own death, and that is why I am now, in the aftermath, having to handle all of it in my head.

I may never again reach my old dreams but I got the gift of being able to live many years more. The movies taught me that even though the battle is fought and the journey is over the wound is still healing, and it gave me hope to get back to my old energy and motivation for life. For that I thank Tolkien and everyone of the cast and those who worked on the movies and I leave this as a token of appreciation to how much something ""so little"" meant to me at the end of this year.

To be honest my entire life i thought The Hobbit and The Lord of the rings were to totally different things untill i googled ‚Äúwhats the first lotr movie.‚Äù But after finding this out it seemed like most people online recommend watching the fellowship of the rings first then the hobbit movies than the rest of the lotr films. But i decided to watch them starting with the hobbit. After watching the first one i was hooked! I felt like an idiot for missing out on these my whole life. And after watching all six i have to say that it is in my opinion that the hobbit films are better than the lotr. I enjoy the characters and more of the dwarves story. I was kind of surprised that Gimli was the only dwarf in the lotr films, that was a let down for me. And if i had to rank them i would say my list is as follows 

Unexpected journey 
Desolation of smaug
Battle of the five armies
Return of the king
Fellowship of the ring

My dad first read me the books (Hobbit + LotR) when I was about 5. My 4 year old loves the LotR movies (his impression of Frodo's anguished cry as Gandalf falls is amazing) and he even likes the first two hobbit movies (he's 4, don't hold it against him). 

We have been reading his favorite scenes from the books for months, and he's just requested to start reading The Hobbit properly. 30 years since my dad read them to me, I bought a brand new illustrated (by Michael Hague in 1984) copy and we begin tonight.

 Some of you will probably think that discussing this subject is pointless or that my opinion is racist or whatever, but i'm not from America and i don't feel that someones race matters that much, it never did to me, i'm not the one for representation or diversity just for diversity's sake, i'm personally completely fine with a movie having an all white cast, or an all black cast, female, male, whatever. What i *would* like though, is if the show is accurate to the books and Tolkien's lore, i would like if it was adapted as it was in the books, because i would enjoy it more if i could experience it as closely as Tolkien himself envisioned, that's all that matters to me. Ofcourse the show itself will surely take a lot of liberties, and maybe it should. But basically i prefer artistic accuracy over forced representation, but it's nowhere near a dealbreaker for me, nor does it bother me that much. 


I know the setting is based on the old Europe, so most of characters in art are usually depicted as white people. But in the books themselves, are there any black men in the Middle-earth and where? I got the notion that the people of Arda haven't migrated that much yet or have they? Has Tolkien ever described any character as dark skinned? Are there dark skinned elves?


Can this work without being lore breaking? What do you think about this?  Is skin colour of humans and other species of Middle-Earth even important?

In Hobbit and fellowship there weren't many instances where Tolkien pointed out "" this character is light skinned or dark skinned"", could this be used for artistic freedom or has Tolkien ever said that ALL elves/dwarves/men in Lotr are light skinned?


Almost everyone in Peter Jackson's adaptations is light skinned, is that accurate or just weird? I genuenly have no idea, what is it like in the other books and what do you think about it?","So the new Amazon LOTR show will have a racially diverse cast, is that accurate to the Middle-earth canon from the books?"

Son of Finw√´ and M√≠riel, his name meant Spirit of Fire, for so hot was the fire that burnt in his spirit that his mother died soon after his birth. He is said to have been the mightiest of the Noldor and the best craftsman in history. He made the Palant√≠ri, invented the Tengwar script, and created the most beautiful jewels that Arda ever saw: the Silmarils. However he was selfish and arrogant, and his actions led to kinslaying and war. He and his sons swore and oath, that they would pursuit any creature who withheld a Silmaril from them and thus F√´anor died chasing Morgoth, when after fighting long and alone against the Balrogs, Gothmog, their leader, slew him.

-Gil-galad, Star of Radiance, Artan√°ro, High King of the Noldor, King of Lindon and Lord of Eriador. Of unclear parentage, Gil-galad grew to become High King of Elves in Middle Earth, for he was a friend of the Noldor and the Sindar. He dwellt in many places before establishing his kingdom in Lindon. There he perceived the dark intentions of Sauron, disguised as Annatar. He later joined forces with Elendil against Mordor, during the War of the Last Alliance. Together, they valiantly gave their life in battle to destroy the body of the Dark Lord and bring peace to the peoples of Middle Earth.

And they were really good. I obviously noticed the same things people have (wonky physics and how clean and everything and everyone (except Gandalf for some reason) looks mainly) but beyond that, I loved it.

I especially liked the Dol Goldur sequence, as the LOTR proper didnt have very much magic on magic going on so seeing a full on battle like that was incredible.

Also how when it slips it on he likes being ""invisible"" and all the other things...I realized there is a sort of modern ring of power today much like Bilbo's. Cell Phones. I've noticed it is hard for me to part with my phone. And I carry it wherever I go and always know where I last placed it unknowingly. Where ever I'm on it it's like I feel ""invisible"".

One thing I noticed is that in the pre level cinematics, Gandalf talks about how the war in RotK was an idea that he had from the very start when he found out that Bilbo had the ring.
He says it was all a diversion so Frodo and Sam would go through Mordor unguarded, which did happen yes, but I don't know if it was intentional. 

This suggests that he knew the fellowship would split, along with Sauron's plan to attack Minas Tirith. But the films seem to contradict this.

1267,lotr,"The part at the beginning of Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring when Bilbo drops the Ring before leaving Hobbiton is one of my favorite scenes in the movies, for two reasons. The first one is that Bilbo leaving the Ring behind is the only time anyone ever gave it up - Isildur cut it off of Sauron, then he got killed in a river and let the Ring drift away like Dobie Gray for 2,500 years until D√©agol found it, then he got killed by Sm√©agol, who lost it in his cave, and then Bilbo found it, and he kept it until his 111th birthday. Then  Frodo picked it up, took it on a quest, and then had his finger bitten off by Gollum who then fell into the volcano. 

The other reason, I just noticed tonight at two in the morning. Right after he drops the Ring, about twenty seconds after, possibly the best chance for Sauron almost comes to fruition: Gandalf stands over the Ring and bends down to pick it up, but he stops right before his fingers touch it. They come really close, it looks like less than a centimeter away; it's strange to think that tiny little bit could make such a difference, but as soon as he touched it he'd be corrupted by the will of Sauron, and through him it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine.",Something I've noticed while watching Fellowship of the Ring

Gandalf is a fascinating character, and someone about whom I have been reading as I make my way through the books again.

I have a few questions that hopefully someone better read with Tolkien lore can help me with.

1. How is Gandalf‚Äôs power related to his body? We know that he holds a Balrog at bay, yet is killed by it, only to be returned as Gandalf the White. One essay I read on this said that ‚ÄòGandalf‚Äôs body failed him‚Äô, which was in interesting way of putting it. If Gandalf is an Istari and an Angelic being, is he sort of repressed in his human form? How powerful is Gandalf, and how is this affected by being in a human body?

2. How was Saruman able to defeat and capture Gandalf? If they are the same order of being, is Saruman just more powerful? Again, is this affected by their inhabiting mortal bodies, or something else? We don‚Äôt see it in the books, but the films depict a duel which Saruman wins.

3. Is it assumed that the returned Gandalf the White is more powerful than the departing Gandalf the Grey? Was this to enable him to finish his mission?

1390,lotr,"Hi,

I was a big fan of LotR in my early teens and started a small collection of LotR-related books: I obviously had the Hobbit, the LotR books, and the Silmarillion, plus I remember having a few LotR encyclopedias/guides/atlases and Tolkien biographies. HOWEVER, I lent them to an ex of mine and he lost all of them (I am still bitter about it to this day especially considering a middle-class teenager living in a developing country  like I was practically didn't have any money). Over the years my fandom has gotten cold (I'm 31 now) but a recent rewatch of the movies made me realize again just how awesome LotR is.

So I want to begin again and start a new collection of LotR books. I, however, don't know how to, especially since I haven't ""kept up"" with the fandom. What do you think should I have in my collection, given that I have a limited budget?

Your recommendations would be helpful.

Thanks!

TL;DR: see title.",What are the LotR books every fan must absolutely have?

1392,lotr,"M√°riess√´, peoples of Middle-Earth! I am excited to say that I got the extended Hobbit trilogy for Christmas, and my mother, father, and twin brother both agreed to watch through the entire LotR saga with me, starting chronologically from The Hobbit (please don't attack me about the watch order lol). As the attention span of my fam is small, I think it would be best to split each movie into two segments, one for each day. Here is my question: what do you think are the best times for an intermission between each of the Hobbit movies? Any advice would be much appreciated! :D",How should I pace watching the Hobbit trilogy? (EE)
1393,lotr,,"My wife got me autographs of: Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys-Davies, Martin Freeman, and Ian Mckellen. But, Sir Ian's autograph wont be here till February, since it's coming from England. All have COA's. She got me a hat with Harrison Ford's autograph too. Since I'm an Indy fan. She knows me so well!"
1394,lotr,"Galadriel the greatest Elf in Valinor (the equal of Feanor), is described as very very generous and kind and deeply in love with the Valar. The only person who she utterly hated was uncle Feanor. Yet, not only she didn't try to stop the Revolt of Feanor against the Valar, she actually joined the Revolt as a leader and encouraged the Elves to leave the Undying Lands. 

She had dreams of adventuring in Middle-earth and ruling a realm of her own there. (Which she made them come true. She travelled most of Middle-earth. And she ruled 1 or 2 big realms of her own, and many small cities as a fief)

Even after Feanor mercilessly butchered Galadriel's motherkin to steal their ships, though Galadriel heroically fought against Feanor in defence of her motherkin, she did not turn back. ""Her pride was unwilling to return, a defeated suppliant for pardon"" even after Feanor did not send the ships back and burned them so they couldn't make it to Middle-earth, still she did not turn back. Even after hearing the terrible Doom/Prophecy of Mandos the Vala/god of Fate and death, SHE DID NOT TURN BACK! And she came under the Curse/Doom of Mandos. ""now she burned with desire to follow F√´anor with her anger to whatever lands he might come, and to thwart him in all ways that she could."" (Feanor got himself killed before Galadriel set foot in M.E lol) 

""The fire of their hearts was young, and led by Fingolfin and his sons, and by Finrod and Galadriel, they dared to pass into the bitterest North; and finding no other way [to M.E] they endured at last the terror of the Helcarax√´ and the cruel hills of ice. Few of the deeds of the Noldor thereafter surpassed that desperate crossing in hardihood or woe.""

In Middle-earth in FA Galadriel ignored her dream of ruling a realm of her own. Because the Kings sucked! Instead of uniting to defeat Morgoth the Dark Lord they were in conflict with theirselves. Thus Galadriel believed it would be unwise to establish a realm. ""[Galadriel and Celeborn] did not join in the war against Angband, which they judged to be hopeless under the ban of the Valar and without their aid; and their counsel was to withdraw from Beleriand and to build up a power to the eastward (whence they feared that Morgoth would draw reinforcement), befriending and teaching the Dark Elves and Men of those regions. But such a policy having no hope of acceptance among the Elves of Beleriand, Galadriel and Celeborn departed over Ered Lindon before the end of the First Age"" The only battles of War of the Jewels that Galadriel fought in was when she set foot on Middle-earth and they were immediately assaulted by the armies of Morgoth. This and probably in War of Wrath when the fleeing servants of Morgoth came to Eriador where Galadriel was the Lady. (We have barely any information about War of Wrath though it was the greatest battle)

After the Valar sent aid and Morgoth got overthrown, the Doom/Ban was lifted. The entire Beleriand sank down into ocean ""The love of the Elves for their land and their works is deeper than the deeps of the Sea, and their regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be assuaged."" You can understand how deeply Galadriel was in pain. Yet she rejected the pardon of the Valar and did not return to Valinor where she could get healed to some extent. The reasons? Her pride was the chief reason. The other stated reasons are: for love of Celeborn who didn't desire to leave, and for her dreams, and she took it upon herself that it is her responsibility to save Middle-earth from the remaining evil. Therefore she stayed and remained under the Ban.

Gil-Galad the freaking grandson of Galadriel's brother became the High-King of the Noldor. Now everywhere was in peace. If I was Galadriel I would've asked Gil-Galad to give up the title to me. Galadriel had all the rights for it. But she didn't want it, though I believe she greatly desired it. Gil-Galad was not under the Curse, while Galadriel was. And Galadriel well knew Sauron the murderer of her brother and many other great servants of Morgoth had escaped and they will rise again and it is better to let someone who is not under the Doom to be the High-King.

*Skip to Third Age* Galadriel wore Nenya the Ring of Adamant and Water, and it made her feel extremely homesick. She used to live with both the Noldor and the Teleri of the Sea in Valinor. Nenya awoke her latent desire for the Sea and to return to Valinor, and her joy in Middle-earth got diminished. So she left Lorien and Rivendell and decided to live near the rivers and the Sea. Yet she never prayed to the Valar to forgive her and let her come back. Instead, she would say ""What wrong did the golden house of Finarfin do that I should ask the pardon of the Valar?""

News came from Lorien 'Amroth the King of Lorien is dead! Moria has felled! They awoke the Balrog and now Orcs are pouring out of Moria. Lorien is in great danger. People are fleeing from Lorien. It will soon become the territory of the Enemy'

Galadriel now did not even desire to rule anymore. But she returned to Lorien and saved it. She renounced the title of King/Queen. I think because she wanted to save herself from her demons, she chose 'The Lady' as her offical title. Yet 1030y later during the time of LotR we see her saying : ""I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to ask what you offer. For many long years I had pondered what I might do, should the Great Ring come into my hands,""

""at last all that she had desired in her youth came to her hand, the Ring of Power and the dominion of Middle-earth which she had dreamed""

If she doesn't accept the Ring, her land will be destroyed. ""For if you fail, then we are laid bare to the Enemy. Yet if you succeed, then our power is diminished, and Lothl√≥rien will fade [because it will no longer be a magical Timeless place, if the One Ring gets destroyed all other Rings would lose their powers], and the tides of Time will sweep it away. We must depart into the West, or dwindle to a rustic folk of dell and cave, slowly to forget and to be forgotten.""

Depart into the West? Her people can but she herself cannot, for she is under the Ban.

Sacrificing her land? It would greatly damage her soul. Almost all Elves, especially the Noldor Elves, prefer to die rather than to give up on their great works. ""The love of the Elves for their land and their works is deeper than the deeps of the Sea, and their regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be assuaged."" 

But her wisdom was full grown now. And she did. She sacrificed her land. She overcame the overwhelming temptation to take the Ring for herself. She gifted The Phial, (probably) her crowning achievement in art, to a mortal. She gifted many great gifts and many of her great works of art to the Fellowship. 

Seems like something like a divine vision came to her and showed her that she can return now. But that vision faded away. And she started singing sad songs again. 

""I sang of leaves, of leaves of gold, and leaves of gold there grew:

Of wind I sang, a wind there came and in the branches blew....

....But if of ships I now should sing, what ship would come to me,

What ship would bear me ever back across so wide a Sea?""

""...Now lost, lost to those from the East is Valimar! Farewell! Maybe thou shalt find Valimar. Maybe even thou shalt find it. Farewell!""

Tolkien letter : ""The Exiles were allowed to return - save for a few chief actors in the rebellion, of whom at the time of The Lord of the Rings only Galadriel remained. At the time of her Lament in L√≥rien she believed this to be perennial, as long as the Earth endured. Hence she concludes her lament with a wish or prayer that Frodo may as a special grace be granted a purgatorial (but not penal) sojourn in Eress√´a, the solitary isle in sight of Aman, though for her the way is closed. Her prayer was granted - but also her personal ban was lifted, in reward for her services against Sauron, and above all for her rejection of the temptation to take the Ring when offered to her. So at the end we see her taking ship.""

Galadriel the Last Surviving Rebel, after 7000y finally overcame the Doom of Mandos. She impressed the Valar so much that they forgave her and lifted the Ban on her.

She actually became so mighty and high respected in the eyes of the Valar that the Valar were willing to break the rules for her! When Gimli came to the Undying Lands where he and any other mortals were forbidden to come (Ring-bearers had this blessing to live in Valinor, Gimli and any other mortals did not), Galadriel asked the Valar and granted Gimli this grace to live in Valinor.",Galadriel is one of the best well-written characters ever [explained]

1. Galadriel. In the movies as well as some artist renderings she turns into a sort of witch when she is wielding her powers. By that I mean she has a sort of dirty wet look, like she just crawled out of a swamp. Is this cannon? Is there something nefarious or evil about the powers she has? 
2. Do the common folk of middle earth have any idea what is going on in the greater scheme of things? By this I mean someone like Frodo, or Samwise, or a random citizen of Rohan or Gondor. Do they think Gandalf is just a some sort of goofy old magician? Do they have any sort of religion? Are they even aware of Eru Iluvatar being the creator? Do they have any sense of History? How ignorant are these people?

1516,lotr,"It is very likely they were friends since Artanis Galadriel was a kid. Because Olorin was a great Elf-friend and he often visited Elves, in disguise and gave them fair visions. Galadriel was the greatest Elf in Valinor, the equal of Feanor. Except she wasn't a jerk like him. She and her father and brother were the wisest and the most generous and caring Elves; things that Olorin liked.

When Olorin Gandalf arrived to Middle-earth, he immediately visited Galadriel to give her a gift from the Valar. He could give this gift to any High-Elf, but he chose Galadriel.

""I was at the White Council, and of all those there gathered none did I love more than Gandalf the Grey. Often have we met since and spoken of many things and purposes."" They used to meet even before the Council, but rarely because Gandalf was always on an adventure, helping people. It became more often when the Shadow grow in Dol Guldur. 

Galadriel : ""I it was who first summoned the White Council. And if my designs had not gone amiss, it would have been governed by Gandalf the Grey, and then mayhap things would have gone otherwise.""

Saruman to Gandalf : ""And as for the Lady here, I do not trust her: she always hated me, and schemed for your part.""

Galadriel : ""Gandalf the Grey set out with the Company, but he did not pass the borders of this land. Now tell us where he is; for I much desired to speak with him again. But I cannot see him from afar, unless he comes within the fences of Lothl√≥rien: a grey mist is about him, and the ways of his feet and of his mind are hidden from me.""

The Fellowship answered he died in Moria. 

Celeborn : ""if it were possible, one would say that at the last Gandalf fell from wisdom into folly, going needlessly into the net of Moria.""

"" 'He would be rash indeed that said that thing,' said Galadriel gravely. 'Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life. Those that followed him knew not his mind and cannot report his full purpose.' ""

"" 'Do not let me fall!' I [Gandalf] gasped, for I felt life in me again. 'Bear me to Lothl√≥rien!'

' 'That indeed is the command of the Lady Galadriel who sent me to look for you,' he [Lord of the Eagles] answered. ""

'Then it is true, as √âomer reported, that you are in league with the Sorceress of the Golden Wood?' said Wormtongue. 'It is not to be wondered at: webs of deceit were ever woven in Dwimordene.'

Gimli strode a pace forward, but felt suddenly the hand of Gandalf clutch him by the shoulder, and he halted, standing stiff as stone.

In Dwimordene, in L√≥rien

Seldom have walked the feet of Men,

Few mortal eyes have seen the light

That lies there ever, long and bright.

Galadriel! Galadriel!

Clear is the water of your well;

White is the star in your white hand;

Unmarred, unstained is leaf and land

In Dwimordene, in L√≥rien

More fair than thoughts of Mortal Men.

Thus Gandalf softly sang, and then suddenly he changed. Casting his tattered cloak aside, he stood up and leaned no longer on his staff; and he spoke in a clear cold voice. 'The wise speak only of what they know, Gr√≠ma son of G√°lm√≥d. A witless worm have you become. Therefore be silent, and keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.

1581,lotr,"Galadriel the greatest Elf in Valinor (the equal of Feanor), is described as very very generous and kind and deeply in love with the Valar. The only person who she utterly hated was uncle Feanor. Yet, not only she didn't try to stop the Revolt of Feanor against the Valar, she actually joined the Revolt as a leader and encouraged the Elves to leave the Undying Lands. 

She had dreams of adventuring in Middle-earth and ruling a realm of her own there. (Which she made them come true. She travelled most of Middle-earth. And she ruled 1 or 2 big realms of her own, and many small cities as a fief)

Even after Feanor mercilessly butchered Galadriel's motherkin to steal their ships, though Galadriel heroically fought against Feanor in defence of her motherkin, she did not turn back. ""Her pride was unwilling to return, a defeated suppliant for pardon"" even after Feanor did not send the ships back and burned them so they couldn't make it to Middle-earth, still she did not turn back. Even after hearing the terrible Doom/Prophecy of Mandos the Vala/god of Fate and death, SHE DID NOT TURN BACK! And she came under the Curse/Doom of Mandos. ""now she burned with desire to follow F√´anor with her anger to whatever lands he might come, and to thwart him in all ways that she could."" (Feanor got himself killed before Galadriel set foot in M.E lol) 

""The fire of their hearts was young, and led by Fingolfin and his sons, and by Finrod and Galadriel, they dared to pass into the bitterest North; and finding no other way [to M.E] they endured at last the terror of the Helcarax√´ and the cruel hills of ice. Few of the deeds of the Noldor thereafter surpassed that desperate crossing in hardihood or woe.""

In Middle-earth in FA Galadriel ignored her dream of ruling a realm of her own. Because the Kings sucked! Instead of uniting to defeat Morgoth the Dark Lord they were in conflict with theirselves. Thus Galadriel believed it would be unwise to establish a realm. ""[Galadriel and Celeborn] did not join in the war against Angband, which they judged to be hopeless under the ban of the Valar and without their aid; and their counsel was to withdraw from Beleriand and to build up a power to the eastward (whence they feared that Morgoth would draw reinforcement), befriending and teaching the Dark Elves and Men of those regions. But such a policy having no hope of acceptance among the Elves of Beleriand, Galadriel and Celeborn departed over Ered Lindon before the end of the First Age"" The only battles of War of the Jewels that Galadriel fought in was when she set foot on Middle-earth and they were immediately assaulted by the armies of Morgoth. This and probably in War of Wrath when the fleeing servants of Morgoth came to Eriador where Galadriel was the Lady. (We have barely any information about War of Wrath though it was the greatest battle)

After the Valar sent aid and Morgoth got overthrown, the Doom/Ban was lifted. The entire Beleriand sank down into ocean ""The love of the Elves for their land and their works is deeper than the deeps of the Sea, and their regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be assuaged."" You can understand how deeply Galadriel was in pain. Yet she rejected the pardon of the Valar and did not return to Valinor where she could get healed to some extent. The reasons? Her pride was the chief reason. The other stated reasons are: for love of Celeborn who didn't desire to leave, and for her dreams, and she took it upon herself that it is her responsibly to save Middle-earth from the remaining evil and not to depart. Thus she remained under the Ban. 

Gil-Galad the freaking grandson of Galadriel's brother became the High-King of the Noldor. Now everywhere was in peace. If I was Galadriel I would've asked Gil-Galad to give up the title to me. Galadriel had all the rights for it. But she didn't want it, though I believe she greatly desired it. Gil-Galad was not under the Curse, while Galadriel was. And Galadriel well knew Sauron the murderer of her brother and many other great servants of Morgoth had escaped and they will rise again and it is better to let someone who is not under the Doom to be the High-King.

*Skip to Third Age* Galadriel wore Nenya the Ring of Adamant and Water, and it made her feel extremely homesick. She used to live with both the Noldor and the Teleri of the Sea in Valinor. Nenya awoke her latent desire for the Sea and to return to Valinor, and her joy in Middle-earth got diminished. So she left Lorien and Rivendell and decided to live near the rivers and the Sea. Yet she never prayed to the Valar to forgive her and let her come back. Instead, she would say ""What wrong did the golden house of Finarfin do that I should ask the pardon of the Valar?""

News came from Lorien 'Amroth the King of Lorien is dead! Moria has felled! They awoke the Balrog and now Orcs are pouring out of Moria. Lorien is in great danger. People are fleeing from Lorien. It will soon become the territory of the Enemy'

Galadriel now did not even desire to rule anymore. But she returned to Lorien and saved it. She renounced the title of King/Queen. I think because she wanted to save herself from her demons, she chose 'The Lady' as her offical title. Yet 1030y later during the time of LotR we see her saying : ""I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to ask what you offer. For many long years I had pondered what I might do, should the Great Ring come into my hands,""

""at last all that she had desired in her youth came to her hand, the Ring of Power and the dominion of Middle-earth which she had dreamed""

If she doesn't accept the Ring, her land will be destroyed. ""For if you fail, then we are laid bare to the Enemy. Yet if you succeed, then our power is diminished, and Lothl√≥rien will fade [because it will no longer be a magical Timeless place, if the One Ring gets destroyed all other Rings would lose their powers], and the tides of Time will sweep it away. We must depart into the West, or dwindle to a rustic folk of dell and cave, slowly to forget and to be forgotten.""

Depart into the West? Her people can but she herself cannot, for she is under the Ban.

Sacrificing her land? It would greatly damage her soul. Almost all Elves, especially the Noldor Elves, prefer to die rather than giving up on their great works. ""The love of the Elves for their land and their works is deeper than the deeps of the Sea, and their regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be assuaged."" 

But her wisdom was full grown now. And she did. She sacrificed her land. She overcame the overwhelming temptation to take the Ring for herself. She gifted The Phial, (probably) her crowning achievement in art, to a mortal. She gifted many great gifts and many of her great works of art to the Fellowship. 

Seems like something like a divine vision came to her and showed her that she can return now. But that vision faded away. And she started singing sad songs again. 

""I sang of leaves, of leaves of gold, and leaves of gold there grew:

Of wind I sang, a wind there came and in the branches blew....

....But if of ships I now should sing, what ship would come to me,

What ship would bear me ever back across so wide a Sea?""

""...Now lost, lost to those from the East is Valimar! Farewell! Maybe thou shalt find Valimar. Maybe even thou shalt find it. Farewell!""

Tolkien letter : ""The Exiles were allowed to return - save for a few chief actors in the rebellion, of whom at the time of The Lord of the Rings only Galadriel remained. At the time of her Lament in L√≥rien she believed this to be perennial, as long as the Earth endured. Hence she concludes her lament with a wish or prayer that Frodo may as a special grace be granted a purgatorial (but not penal) sojourn in Eress√´a, the solitary isle in sight of Aman, though for her the way is closed. Her prayer was granted - but also her personal ban was lifted, in reward for her services against Sauron, and above all for her rejection of the temptation to take the Ring when offered to her. So at the end we see her taking ship.""

Galadriel the Last Surviving Rebel, after 7000y finally overcame the Doom of Mandos. She impressed the Valar so much that they forgave her and lifted the Ban on her.

She actually became so mighty and high respected in the eyes of the Valar that the Valar were willing to break the rules for her! When Gimli came to the Undying Lands where he and any other mortals were forbidden to come (Ring-bearers had this blessing to live in Valinor, Gimli and any other mortals did not), Galadriel asked the Valar and granted Gimli this grace to live in Valinor.","Galadriel, one of the best characters ever."

1603,lotr,"Since it's the season for Christmas movies, I watched the Muppet Christmas Carol last night, and that reminded me that when I last read through the Hobbit, I automatically pictured Bombur as looking just like ""The Ghost of Christmas Present"" from that film, only smaller. I realized where my mental picture came from during the time where he was sleeping after falling into the stream in Mirkwood. Anyone else have a similar association?

And as an aside, do most people realize how half of the Hobbit dwarves are unremarkable in the book? Thorin is proud and the leader, Balin is old and wise and observant, Fili &amp; Kili are young and energetic, Bombur is fat, and Dori is strong (mainly for carrying Bilbo, but you'd be hard-pressed to name a difference between Ori, Nori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bifur, and Dwalin, except that Dwalin may be a little older. (Yes, I know Gloin is Gimli's father, but that is part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, not mentioned in or relevant to the Hobbit.",I imagine Bombur as Muppet Ghost of Christmas Present!

1608,lotr,"Everyone just heaps praise on the Hobbits; we talk about them as if they're the ideal race of Middle Earth. They're humble, appreciate good food and drink and a simple life, but when necessary are capable of true bravery and heroism. But the books have me a little more conflicted than I had expected to be.

Now, I'm not talking about our main heroes of Bilbo, Frodo, Sam, Merry, or Pippin. These five hobbits are very pure in intent and deed, as far as I'm concerned, from start to finish. However, in the chapter 'A Long-Expected Party', Tolkien spends a number of pages describing the actions of the rest of the hobbits with regard to Bilbo's gifts and the handling of his estate upon his departure from the Shire. And they're just, all so...grubby.

&gt; Frodo had a very trying time that afternoon. A false rumour that the whole household was being distributed free spread like wildfire; and before long the place was packed with people who had no business there, but could not be kept out. Labels got torn off and mixed, and quarrels broke out. Some people tried to do swaps and deals in the hall; and others tried to make off with minor items not addressed to them, or with anything that seemed unwanted or unwatched.

&gt; Then they went round the hole, and evicted three young hobbits (two Boffins and a Bolger) who were knocking holes in the walls of one of the cellars. Frodo also had a tussle with young Sancho Proudfoot (old Odo Proudfoot‚Äôs grandson), who had begun an excavation in the larger pantry, where he thought there was an echo. 

If I were Frodo, and I'd just been bequeathed my inheritence of Bag End only to find my neighbors literally destroying the place in search of riches that were absolutely left to me, I would consider myself in the presence of thieving criminals. Not to mention the behavior of those invited to Bilbo's 'intimate dinner' and speech. The Hobbits behave like spoiled children; they can't stand the fact that, at this lavish and exuberant party put on and paid for in full by Bilbo, they should have to listen to him speak for more than a few sentences. I understand that there are customs that Bilbo is breaking, but what childish customs! What lack of respect!

Please either help me feel assured in this opinion or help me have a more positive view of Hobbits as a whole, because for all the talk of Hobbits valuing the truly important things in life, they seemed awfully depraved when presented with what they thought was a license to loot the home of their longtime neighbor when in reality there was a very clearly defined will which left the majority of Bilbo's possessions to Frodo and select gifts to select friends and family.",Am I missing something about Hobbits?

1655,lotr,"I could be missing something in all this so correct me if I get anything wrong, but my understanding is that the Dwarves had quite a bad time with legendary monsters and the like (more than once) seizing their mountain homes and their treasure.

Overtime they try to move elsewhere and reestablish new homes but even that often didn‚Äôt work.

After awhile I‚Äôd think they would realize that they need to remove these legendary monsters at all costs and without doing so this stuff was gonna keep happening to them over and over again.

It was also clear they lacked the power to defeat these beasts on their own, even with armies (couldn‚Äôt beat Durin‚Äôs Bane and couldn‚Äôt Smaug in traditional combat either).

Now, you could argue that Thorin at least WAS asking for aid in the Hobbit, but why not try to get the elves to help you or seek out Saruman sooner regarding Durin‚Äôs Bane for example.

Was it just that no one else cared? Was it that no one else had the means either? I would think something Iike Smaug or the Balrog would be threats to literally everyone so dispatching them would be a great priority for the powerful leaders of the world, no?

1756,lotr,"Now, I know media/art is subjective and no opinion can be passed as true, I just want to vent a little and throw it out there.

I just recently watched the Fellowship in 4k, and was once again mesmerized that production of this quality exists in my lifetime. The fact that movie like Fellowship Of The Ring and the whole trilogy exists is nothing short of a miracle. Why ?

* The rare example where studio doesn't interfere (partly due to filming away from Hollywood) while providing a massive budget for the first film of a NEW franchise (movie-wise of course). You rarely see big projects that don't have either established franchise or well known director at the steering wheel anymore. I know people say that they didn't cost that much, but they were always meant to be big blockbusters, not some indie connoisseur flicks, and that requires money.
* Massive project that slowly takes it's time to develop (over 2 years of preproduction, planning things, storyboarding, crafting sets, costumes and props), with all three movies filmed at once before the first, to save money and have more time for postproduction for each of them without rushing.
* The movie was made in a perfect time of cinema history, when CGI was good enough to use for otherwise unfilmable scenes, but not good enough to rely on it whenever possible to save money, like in Hobbit or any new big action movie, so practical effects were always a must to some extent.
* Choosing lesser known actors (apart from a few of them ofc.) to save money and make characters feel more unique and real, instead of throwing ones we've seen tens of times in other movies, even if they're excellent. Known faces draw attention and studio executives know that, using it as a marketing tool.
* Commitment. The filming crew had to move to New Zealand in time of production for quite a long time, and the country itself and it's laws made filming cheaper and easier. You can also see how much seemingly unnecessary work went into mundane details or very brief shots in the documentaries. 

In conclusion, the stars aligned to make the environment for filming cheaper, more creative, stress-free and though out, as much as it was possible in such a big project.

Why Fellowship of all three then ?

* It has a tough task of introducing us to a world that is quite out there, without being seen as cheesy or boring, and it excels at that
* It's the most personal and focused story, keeping all the characters together and never delving too much onto the epic, flashy moments like the others two often do. (that's mainly due to the structure of the book of course)
* It ages well and looks organic, because of minimal use of CGI, filming on location, shooting on film, using prosthetics, using miniatures and dirty, earthy, old-looking aesthetic (I don't really know how to explain it, but there isn't really any places that are sterile, everything looks like it's washed out, centuries old and ancient)
* Clever film-making techniques to reduce costs, like forced perspective or using CGI shots as briefly as possible, with moria being a masterful example of that, see this great [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7snho0/how_the_hell_did_they_make_lord_of_the_rings_for/dt69265?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) for details
* The MUSIC, Howard Shore's original score is pretty much a character on its own in this movie and my favorite thing about the whole trilogy. It ALWAYS enhances the mood of the scenes and places, builds and releases tension, fleshes out characters personalities and thoughts, and the ENDING, ironically my favorite part of it, when it just gently calms you down and eases back to the real word with a simple humming melody, and you just feel so calm, hopeful and inspired
* It really has something for everyone. Timeless themes of hope, friendship, brotherhood, honor. Action fans have sequences like Fight in Moria and Amon Hen. Comedy fans have some great witty dialogue that builds character and never takes you out of the immersion. Drama fans have the death of Gandalf and the ending with Sam and Frodo. Adventure fans have the whole concept of a brave group of individuals on journey through mysterious and dangerous lands. There are many movies that can be called masterpieces, but not many would be enjoyed by such a huge amount of demographics and also movie critics. The Godfather might be stellar, but 10 year old me wouldn't enjoy it as much as LOTR.

Do you think that movie/movies of this scope and artistry can ever be made again ? 

I feel like we still get some amazing movies nowadays, but they usually fall more and more on the opposite sides of big entertaining blockbusters/artistic indie flicks spectrum, rarely something in between, and with signs of movie industry moving towards streaming platforms for anything but big established IP productions like Marvel/Star Wars it has me worried that we won't get big original movies again. What are your thoughts on that ?",Fellowship of the Ring might just be the greatest movie ever made.

So say Gollum isn't there, and Frodo puts the ring on and crip walks his ass past Samwise Gamgee and out of Mt Doom... What next? My assumption is to take it directly to Barad Dur and ask Sauron for a hefty slice of some conceptual form of power in return for bringing him his ring? Or would he bizarrely attempt to evade the forces of Mordor as he leaves the place most dense with them, despite being VERY visible to them, and finding a nice cave to hide in for a few thousand years?",What exactly was Frodo planning to do with the One Ring once he claimed it for himself in Mt Doom?

And she had an insight that isn't really made clear in the movies, but makes total sense.

Boromir wants to use the Ring as a weapon against Sauron. Faramir wants to use it as a weapon, or to give it to his father. Galadriel even thinks about it for a minute. This always confused me. It makes you invisible, and otherwise... It's only useful to Sauron. What did they think they were going to do with it? Why did they think it was a weapon?

So my wife is like **""The Ring is basically a liar, right?""**

And... Yeah. What it can *actually* do is beside the point. If Denthor got his hands on it, it's not like he can smite the armies of Mordor. It's just a ring. All he can do is draw attention to it. And it's only good to Sauron.",The Ring's greatest power

- I really liked how complex the world is, tolkien has all of my respect for his work;
- Thankfully everyone stayed in-character (cough cough got)
- I REALLY hated the plot armor, man it was so predictable and annoying in my opinion.
- The orcs (and every ""dark"" soldier) being so stupid and useless 
- It was so ""black and white"", like, you have the good guys and then there's the big bad one that wants to end the world etc etc, there was really no middle term, every good guy stayed a 100% good guy, every bad one stayed bad (except gollum, really liked his inner conflict)
- It was such a happy ending for me, like yes frodo had to left (didnt really understand why) and that kind of gave a sense of loss but besides that, everybody got what they wanted
- Overall, I liked to watch the trilogy (in terms of cinematography no other film can beat this, so ahed of its time), but I gotta say I was expecting a bit more frok what I heard, so i considered lotr a great series, but kind of overrated.

Yes the CGI is almost too much and doesn't feel nearly as authentic as LotR.  Yes the characters look and feel much more cartoony (maybe because it's based off a kids book in comparison to LotR).  Yes it's way too long and steers a little to far away from the book at plenty of times.

While I'd say LotR movies are 10 or more times better than the Hobbit movies I still think they are good and when being watched with a fun attitude and not being always compared to LotR they can still be a pleasant viewing.",Hobbit Trilogy

I love this little detail so much. Usually, when you read/watch scenes where a man is dying, his friend's affection would be offset by some sort of joke. But here, we see Aragorn tenderly kiss his brow and it's just, such a vulnerable, sweet thing. Because instead of cramming his love and respect for Boromir in a lofty speech, he does this and it's...it brought me to tears. And his promise to protect Minas Tirith and Boromir's peaceful smile at that really broke my heart in two.

1818,lotr,"Hi! I‚Äôm looking for people to play in an online game I'm running in January, based on LotR and the TV show Survivor.

If you're interested in role-playing and/or social strategy games (like the currently popular Among Us), trying new things or even just looking for fun ways to fill some lockdown time, this game is for you.

The rules will follow those of Survivor where every round a player is voted out, and when only 2 people remain, those voted out in turn vote for the winner. (Here's a 1 minute explanation of the whole process: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1-hTpG_krk)

The game will be hosted on a private forum willed with Middle Earth theming, characters, references and fun Easter eggs for you to pick up on. Everyone will play as someone from LotR and compete in challenges drawn from events in the series. Otherwise it will mostly involve messaging the other characters using an e-mail like system to befriend them, strategise and decide the vote.

Contestants are free to play however they wish, at any level of involvement. You can focus heavily on the role-playing aspect of the characters or focus on the social-strategy, or anything in between - it's entirely up to you. The only thing to keep in mind is that your success largely depends on how the others in your tribe view your style and level of engagement, and how well you are able to adapt.

It lasts roughly 3-4 weeks (with weekends off) starting from January 10 and can be played from any time zone. Although some events will be hosted live (such as Tribal Council, the ceremony before the vote takes places), attendance is optional as you can also cast your votes in advance.

Participation is also anonymous for the duration of the game, in order to keep everything fair. So while I'm eager to answer any general questions in the comments here (and can point you to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineSurvivor/comments/k3isrb/lord_of_the_rings_forumbased_org_now_casting/) written for Survivor fans), I'd ask anyone interested in signing up to please message/chat me privately to discuss all the details including who you would like to play as. :)",Join an online LotR social-strategy game!

1846,lotr,I've been a big fan of LOTR for a while now and I've always wanted to watch the extended editions. And when there were rumors of them being released on 4K I decided to wait then. Fast forward to yesterday I had finally received the Extended Trilogy in 4K Steelbooks and I watched them all with my girlfriend and loved them. Although I want to hear everyone's opinion. What was your favorite addition and your least favorite. I think my favorite was the Boromir flashback in The Two Towers (also my gf had never seen LOTR before so she was asking why I was so shocked during the scene). I loved to see Faramir and Boromirs relationship. I had never read the books or anything so I always kind of assumed Faramir resented Boromir and that Boromir was kind of a d**k. But that one scene fleshed them out so well and I loved it as it changed my perspective of Boromir. And my least favorite was the extra Ghost scenes in Return of the King. IMO I believe it takes away the surprise factor of the trio getting off  of the pirate ships with the ghosts. When Aragorn had looked defeated seeing the pirates come by thinking they were too late. I believe it should have ended there and then see the ship scene. I liked the feeling of hopelessness rather than leaving it open ended in the theatrical so that way when they show up at Minas Tirith it means more but yeah. What do you all think?,Just finished watching The Extended Editions for the first time!
1847,lotr,"So i‚Äôm a 13yo and i decided to take in the challenge of the books. I never watched the movies so this was all totally new to me. It was one of if not the best things i‚Äôve ever read. I had no idea a book can be so dense but also so captivating. I wanted to share with everyone everything I felt about the books. I‚Äôm going to be rating characters not how much I liked them but how much I liked reading them. I‚Äôm ranking from be at to worse. Sorry for any misspellings of misinformed things I wrote. 


The Fellowship

Sam-Probably my favorite book character ever. The way he was so strong and brave was such amazing writing. He went from Frodo‚Äôs servant to someone who could fight for himself and his people his character development is unmatched. And i weeped like a baby in The Choices of Master Samwise. Also his song in the dark tower. 

Gandalf- He was so entertaining and his death was so amazingly sad and beautiful. When he came back I was cheering. His and Pippins relationship was so well done I was so happy to read anything involving them. He was such a great character who brought so much to the world. 

Merry/Pippin- They are ranked together because of how I always enjoyed them and they were so similar. The way the mirror each other with both of them becoming servants of a king was so amazing. When they were with the ents I was so happy to read them together. I was so upset when they were separated but their friendship was so amazing. 

Aragorn-I loved him so much. He was so noble and so kind to his followers and enemies. They way he spared the men who went against him was so inspiring. I truly felt such joy when he arrived at the Battle of Pelennaor Fields. His love with Arwen was so sweet and I loved how they showed him loving her throughout each book. He was the best king the men of Gondor could ask for. 

Gimli/Legolas- Same with Merry and Pippin I felt that they were so similar that it would make no sense for one to be above the other. Their friendship was also amazing the way it expanded their prejudices. I loved them traveling Fangorn and the caves of helms deep was so sweet. I truly felt for them when they were together and I was glad they were never separated. 

Frodo-He was a great character and I loved him and Sam together. He wasn‚Äôt always the best but he was so intriguing with the ring. Him getting corrupted by the ring was so shocking that I audibly gasped when it happened. When he left Sam to go to the Havens I was balling. Their story was so amazing and I‚Äôm glad they grew with each other. 

Boromir-I never really cared for him until he tried to kill and take the ring form Frodo. That was so shocking and I never saw it coming. His death was sad and I truly felt for the fellowship and his family. 

Other Characters

Faramir-So amazing. The minute I saw him treat Frodo and Sam with kindness was when I really started to love him. His story of finding his brothers body on the boat was what made me feel for Boromirs death. Him and √âowyn was so sweet and I really loved them together. His friendship with Aragorn was so amazing and I get chills when I read him waking in the House of Healing. He was a great captain and I understood his spillers love for him. He is of the highest quality. 

Th√©oden- What an amazing king. Him standing up after being a weak old man for so long was so amazing. He was a great king and his death was heartbreaking. His speeches where unrivaled and he was a great commander. I loved his love for his niece and nephew and they were such a strong family. 

√âomer-What a great king. His friendship with Aragorn was also amazing. He was strong and brave and kind and I loved him so much. His relationship with Gimli was so interesting and I love Gimlis line, ‚ÄúYou have chosen the Evening; but my love is given to the Morning.‚Äù What a great quarrel. 

√âowyn-What an awesome arc. Her going form the servant of her uncle to a brave warrior. Her slaying of the Witch King was so awesome I was cheering. Her and Faramir where so sweet and they were so entertaining. Her love of Aragorn was so sweet and I felt for her when he said no to her. 

Galadriel-The morning of which has so much love. While she didn‚Äôt have a character growth I really enjoyed her scenes. Her appreciation for Sam was so kind. Her caring for Gimli even though he was a dwarf was such a sweet scene. 

Elerond-What a good elf. His council was one of my favorite chapters and I loved how he housed the hobbits and the rest of the fellowship. 

Denethor-Such a good story. His devote into madness was done incredibly and was such good story telling. His love for his sons even if shown badly was so strong. His death was so amazing and such a good way to end his arc. 

Arwen-She was sweet but I didn‚Äôt really care for her much. I really liked her and Aragorns love and the way she gave up her immortality for him. I wish we got more of their wedding but I really enjoyed her scenes. 

The 3 Volumes

The Return of the King-Best book I‚Äôve ever read. The battle scenes and friendships going on we‚Äôre done so beautifully. The way most of the book wasn‚Äôt even about the destruction of the ring and more about the journey was great. The scorching of the shire was the best chapter I‚Äôve ever read. The mirroring of Pippin and Merry were so amazing and I loved every time I read about them. I wish we got to see more of the Path of the dead but I did love the story of Minas Tirth. The siege of Gondor and the Battle of Peleannor Farms ante unmatched in the other books. I loved the dynamics of the book and sped through it. All in all this book is a 10/10

The Two Towers-I really enjoyed it and loved almost all of it. I did get bored in much more scenes in this book then RotK but I still loved the dynamics. Book 3 was so good and the three hunters where some of my favorite chapters of the series. Also Merry and Pippin escaping form the orcs and meeting the ents was so awesome. Also Gandalf the white appears which was a great thing. I really enjoyed Helms Deep even though I struggled visualizing it. 9/10

The Fellowship of the Ring-By far the hardest to get through. The beginning of the journey was great but once they left Bag end it was hard for me to keep reading. The old forest was so difficult to read and it took me a week to read the chapter. And I know it‚Äôs unpopular but Tom Bomballidi completely took me out of the story. I just couldn‚Äôt care for him. It was still a very good book and the lore was great. I love all of book 2 and it was such a great journey. 7.5/10

The 6 Books

Book 5-All the battles were great and the whole entity of this book went by so fast. 10/10

Book 3-My favorite dynamic in the books with the introduction of so many great characters. I also sped through this book. 9/10

Book 6- The start was a little slow but by chapter 2 it was picking up. I loved how the main climax was in the first 3 chapters and everything after was rebuilding the world. Obviously the scorching of the shire is in here so it was a great book. It took a little while longer to read it only because I didn‚Äôt want it to end. 9/10

Book 4-I definitely struggled with this book but the payoff was worth it. The journey went slow at first but the world that was built made up for it. Gollum was such a great inclusion and his treachery surprised and didn‚Äôt surprise me. I balled at the end of the book. I took a while to read but I loved it. 8.5/10

Book 2- This book was what kept me reading. The journey of the fellowship was so amazing and I loved the council of Elrond. The way it ends made me so mad I left the other book at home. I read this relatively slow but it was how I absorbed the world. 8/10

Book 1-By far one of the biggest challenges I‚Äôve read. The start is great but once they get to the road it drones on. I still liked it but there were lots of parts that were a bore. It took me 2 months to read this and I needed lots of breaks. 7/10

Battles

Gandalf vs the Balrog- On the edge of my seat the whole time and the conclusion was so amazing I needed to stop and think. 10/10

Peleannor Farms-This was so so amazing. Aragorn coming out to save the day was shocking. √âowyns reveal and then murder of the Witch King with Merrys help was so awesome. I cried when they listed the names of the dead. 10/10

Scorching of the Shire-While this is my favorite chapter it was not the best battle of the books. That is not saying it wasn‚Äôt so amazing. The way the travelers got the shire folk to fight for their freedom was so incredible. The death of the hobbits was so sad and I was so happy at the death of Saruman that I was cheering. 9.5/10

Siege of Gondor- This was amazing and bittersweet. The fall of Faramir and the loss of the gates made me so distressed. I loved the battle but there are others that out weigh it. 9/10

Helms Deep-I wish the battle lasted longer and we had a chance to see more of the destruction of the ents. I struggled to visualize the battle and it was hard for me to picture the wall. However Gimli and Legolas made up for all the downfalls. Their friendship is one of my favorites. 8.5/10

The battle at the Black Gates- It wasn‚Äôt really a battle but of the fighting I wish there was more of it. The fact that most of the orcs fled was disappointing but i was glad there was some death of the enemy. The mouth of Sauron was a great scene though. 8/10

All in all the story of a Hobbit becoming the person who saved the world was amazing. I‚Äôm so glad I got to read the books and can‚Äôt wait to start the movies!",I just finished the books for the first time and I want to rank everything about them.

1851,lotr,"I'm planning on doing some good ol' story writing. I want to explore the world of Middle Earth as pawns from Dragon's Dogma had existed in there as well.

Pawns are immortal beings from the Rift between worlds (better known as the Void) who serve with extreme loyalty and exclusivity those who bear the title of ""Arisen"" (which alone reminds me a lot of Melkor). The Arisen is a person who is chosen by a gigantic, near impossible to kill Red Dragon who rips their heart off their chests and eats them, granting immortality and incredible power at the cost of them having a normal life and a family. The Dragon eventually askes the Arisen that which they love the most for their safety or that of the world. If the Arisen chooses to fight and wins, then the Everfall, a giant tower infinite connecting to the Void, opens. This is all with the purpose of ultimely replacing the Seneschal, God's replacement who lives at the center of the Void because he is on vacation or something (in typical JRPG fashion). The Dragon is an Arisen who died in the Void, facing the Seneschal btw and whose souls are now enslaved. However, the Seneschal is too enslaved to the cycle and were he or she to stop, literally all life would slowly go cold and die (or so we are told). 

When defeated, the pawns go back to the Rift and can later be summoned again, unscathed and in perfect health although a little shamed for not being careful enough and falling in battle. Before being embodied, they look like swirly greenish/purplish clouds in the Rift and appear to be a Hive mind, calling themselves the Legion or Pawn Legion.

Everything about them depends on their master's memory: they take their appearance depending on what and who drives their Master forward towards battle, they supposedly only feel the emotions their Master does, the Arisen's thoughts echo in their head and they can mimic with perfect accuracy their fighting style. They can also do everything their Master's can so by the end of the story they are walking extinction events. They appear to like when their master does good action, but will not interfere ever in what you do. They also possess little to no will on their own, so apart from seeking an Arisen to serve, they really don't do anything on their own, unless they are either incredibly old or are your main Pawn (one created by you, the player, to be your loyal companion), in which they show a lot more personality. Otherwise, they are unfeeling and some argue, have no souls. To quote: ""They lack the...spark that we humans possess""

The reward and ultimate goal for their service appears to be death, as they become human either by time and droid effect or if their master chooses to sacrifice their own existence to become the Seneschal. In the latter case, they will literally snatch their master's body, but whether they remember the Arisen or not is unknown. Everyone thinks they are the Arisen. 

Considering that they appear to either live in or BE the Void, and that Melkor stayed quite a while trapped in there, how could it all fit together if it was the same universe. Could the Dragon/Seneschal and the Pawns obsession with carrying the Arisen to the Void to kill ""God""  and die be linked with Morgoth in some way? They are also not the only thing that spawns out of the void, but they are the only non-monstrous thing that does. (Ex: sirens, gargoyles, undead, animal abominations, etc)","Hello to all, mind helping me out on a little thought experiment?"

1853,lotr,"Until today I had assumed that the ending of LoTR was very straightforward ; Gollum swore upon the One Ring that he would serve Frodo, and is warned multiple times that the ring is fickle, and will hold him to his bond. By finally turning on Frodo and falling to his death in the process, we see that Gollum's greed and obsession with the ring does indeed do him in. 

Ironically of course, Gollum's greed essentially cancels out Frodo's final failure to destroy the Ring, creating a situation (and moral of the story) where obsession with power leads to destruction. 

I was wrong!

***

It is true that Gollum swore upon the Ring, and it is true that Frodo foreshadows his death multiple times. Frodo even goes so far as to say that if Gollum tried to take the ring again, Frodo would put it on and command Gollum to throw himself from a precipice, or to burn himself in fire, and that Gollum's bond to the ring was so strong that he would be forced to obey. If that isn't foreshadowing, I don't know what is. 

And yet, it's more than foreshadowing. There's one crucial moment that changes everything, which occurs as Sam watches Frodo and Gollum fight on the (external) slopes of Mount Doom. See below (emphasis &amp; context added by me).

&gt; Then suddenly, as before under the eaves of the Emyn Muil, Sam saw these two rivals with other vision. A crouching shape, scarcely more than the shadow of a living thing, a creature now wholly ruined and defeated, yet filled with a hideous lust and rage; and before it stood stern, untouchable now by pity, a figure robed in white [Frodo], but at its breast it held a wheel of fire [The Ring]. **Out of the fire there spoke a commanding voice**.

&gt;‚ÄòBegone, and trouble me no more! **If you touch me ever again, you shall be cast yourself into the Fire of Doom.‚Äô**

***

The difference is subtle but crucial; along with being told how he will be held to his word, Gollum has been explicitly told again and again the the ring is fickle, cruel, and may even twist his words in order to hold him accountable in ways he might not expect. So, what is really happening here in Sam's vision?

The One Ring is cursing Gollum on behalf of Frodo, its current master. It is using its magic (the often invisible, incredibly subtle magic Tolkien established in LoTR) to twist Gollum's fate, such is its hatred for disobedience and wont for cruelty. 

Gollum has been warned that if he tried to take the ring, Frodo would put it on and he would order Gollum to throw himself from a precipice, or to burn himself in fire. The One Ring directly told Gollum that if he ever touched him again, he would be cast into Mount Doom.

I recently rewatched Fellowship extended edition, and I noticed a ‚Äúmistake‚Äù in the movie.
We all know the scene where Frodo says to Gandalf that he wishes the ring had never come to him, to which Gandalf replies: ‚ÄúSo do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide, is what to do, with the time that is given to us‚Äù.

It‚Äôs an amazing quote, one that a lot of us hold dear, which is why i was surprised to not be able to find anyone mentioning the fact that Gandalf was ‚Äúmisquoted‚Äù later in the movie.
When Frodo is about to sail off towards Mordor by himself, he remembers the quote a little differently from what was said: ‚ÄúSo do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All you have to decide, is what to do, with the time that is given to you‚Äù.

The other two members were Pippin and Merry, but if I remember the post correctly Elrond wanted someone with more ""wisdom"" to go on the quest with them. I think he wanted Glorfindel to go with them instead, yet Gandalf took Pippin and Merry instead. 

Of course I know understand why that was probably a good idea, because of how emotional taxing carrying the ring is. Yet Elrond had different feelings and wanted someone more capable to go with them. To which Gandalf sorta implied that the chances of success were low anyway, so might as well take friendship over wisdom.

I never read the books, so I was curious to see what the perspectives were from people who have read the books and the folks that know more than what is revealed in the movies.

During that scene in the Two Towers, where Gandalf, Th√©oden and everyone else comes to Orthanc after their victory at Helms Deep, Saruman complains that Gandalf means to steal *""the Keys of Barad-d√ªr itself, I suppose; and the crowns of seven kings, and the rods of the Five Wizards.""* And that's it. Five wizards exist, but we know nothing else about them.

At least that is until Tolkien wrote an essay about the Istari in 1954, which is now published in the *Unfinished Tales.* And in this essay, two of the wizards are described as wearing robes of ""*sea-blue.""* So now at least we know their colours. And Tolkien refers to them as the *""Ithryn Luin""* which simply means *""the Blue Wizards.""*

But unlike Gandalf and Radagast, Tolkien implies that the Blue Wizards may not have been quite so noble. You see, in the same essay we're told that the Blue Wizards ""*passed into the East with Curun√≠r*\[Saruman\]*, but they never returned, and whether they remained in the East...or perished; or as some hold were ensnared by Sauron and became his servants, is not now known...But none of these chances were impossible to be; for, strange indeed though this may seem, the Istari, being clad in bodies of Middle-earth, might...fall away from their purposes. and do evil, forgetting the good in the search for power to effect it.""*

Now this implies that the Blue Wizards either died in the East or were corrupted and fell in league with Sauron. Neither of these are particularly optimistic, but it might explain why so much of the East belongs to the Dark lord. Perhaps there are two evil wizards (similar to Saruman) working dark magic amongst the Easterlings. We just don't know.

But in the same essay, Tolkien does provide names and an origin story for the Blue Wizards. We're told that the Valar of the West (effectively a pantheon of gods and goddesses) chose three Maiar (angels or demi-gods) to be sent to Middle Earth in the bodies of old men, to act as guides to aid the Free Peoples in their struggles against Sauron. And these three Maiar were: Curumo \[Saruman\] - a servant of the god of crafting, Olorin \[Gandalf\] - a servant of the goddess of pity and compassion, and a guy called Alatar - a servant of the god of hunting. Now Alatar is the first of these blue wizards, and we're actually told that he sailed to Middle Earth with a friend called Pallando, who becomes the second Blue Wizard. Fun fact, the goddess of trees and plants also asks Curumo and Olorin to take with them one of her followers, a Maia called Aiwendil. And Aiwendil went on to become known as Radagast, the fifth wizard.

So that's where the blue wizards came from, but once Alatar and Pallando made it to Middle Earth, their actions are once again shrouded in mystery. In a letter published in 1958, Tolkien tells us that ""*they went as emissaries to distant regions, East and South, far out of N√∫menorean range: missionaries to enemy-occupied lands, as it were. What success they had I do not know; but I fear that they failed, as Saruman did, though doubtless in different ways; and I suspect they were founders or beginners of secret cults and 'magic' traditions that outlasted the fall of Sauron.""*

So these *""'secret cults and 'magic' traditions""* are a pretty fascinating detail, but for thirty-eight years that was pretty much all the information that Tolkien gave about Alatar and Pallando. They were simply mysteries of the East.

But then everything changed in 1996. So twenty-three years after Tolkien died, his son Christopher published a book called *The People's of Middle Earth*, which contained a great deal of the Professor's previously unpublished notes. And one of the chapters in this book is called the *Last Writings,* which is a collection of manuscripts written in the final year of Tolkien's life. And guess what Tolkien wrote about just before he died? The Blue Wizards of course!

So in the *Last Writings* Tolkien provided loads of new information about Alatar and Pallando, and he even gives us new names for them. Because of course all the wizards have a ton of names, ie Gandalf, Mithrandir, Thark√ªn, Inc√°nus, Greyhame, L√°thspell, Olorin etc. So Alatar and Pallando may be the Blue Wizards' Maia names, but in Middle Earth we're told they were known as *Morinehtar* (which means *darkness-slayer)* and *R√≥mest√°mo* (which means *helper of the East).*

But that's not all. Because in Tolkien's later writings we're told that Morinehtar and R√≥mest√°mo did not sail to Middle Earth at the same time as Saruman, Gandalf, and Radagast. Instead they arrived much earlier. And they sailed with another familiar face. Glorfindel.

You see Tolkien wrote that in the year 1600 of the Second Age (the same year that Sauron forged the One Ring) Glorfindel returned to Middle Earth, and the Blue Wizards arrived at roughly the same time. Now this would make Morinehtar and R√≥mest√°mo 2841 years older than Gandalf, Saruman, or Radagast, who we are told arrived in the year 1000 of the Third Age.

Now Tolkien even gives us a few more details on what Morinehtar and R√≥mest√°mo got up to in the East, and I have to say it makes for much more cheerful reading than the story we get in the *Unfinished Tales,* where they simply either died or turned evil. Because in the *Last Writings* we're told that Morinehtar and R√≥mest√°mo's *""task was to circumvent Sauron: to bring help to the few tribes of Men that had rebelled from Melkor-worship,* \[and\] *to stir up rebellion...They must have had very great influence on the history of the Second Age and Third Age in weakening and disarraying the forces of East...who would both in the Second Age and Third Age otherwise have...outnumbered the West.""*

How awesome is that? Just consider the possibility that if not for Morinehtar and R√≥mest√°mo, the forces of evil may have been too great for the Free Peoples to defeat. But, because the two Blue Wizards were off in the background, quietly undermining evil in its own territory, the forces of the West were not overrun. It makes me wonder how many pivotal battles they had a hand in. If not for the *Ithryn Luin*, perhaps the Last Alliance would have failed to defeat Sauron the first time. Or perhaps an army of Easterlings would have conquered Gondor centuries before. Or perhaps the Easterlings and Haradrim at Pelennor Fields would have been victorious if not for these two humble Wizards, who kept the darkness at bay, somewhere far off in the wilderness.

There are many many heroes responsible for vanquishing evil in Tolkien's Legendarium, but in addition to all the household names, I think we should spare a thought for the two most underrated heroes. Morinehtar and R√≥mest√°mo. The slayers of Darkness and the friends of the East. The wizards behind the scenes, who saved the West by staying in the East.

So, thank you all very much for reading this, I'd love to hear your thoughts and comments on these mysterious and thought-provoking characters. As some of you may know, I've been working on a series of YouTube videos about Tolkien's Legendarium. The series is called *Tolkien Untangled*, and there are plenty of video essays like this one as well as videos explaining the Silmarillion, and the differences between the Lord of the Rings books and movies. So check out *Tolkien Untangled* on YouTube if you'd like to learn more.

Thanks again everyone. Much love and stay groovy ‚ù§Ô∏è",The Blue Wizards: What does Tolkien tell us?

2061,lotr,"I‚Äôve seen and read several pieces, both on reddit and elsewhere, about Tolkien‚Äôs male characters representing typically ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù features without them being toxic, as well as handling more so ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù characteristics that don‚Äôt hinder their masculinity at all. The men cry, confess their admiration to each other, and so on. Now I agree with this (it‚Äôs one of the reasons I love LotR), but usually in the comments I see people mentioning √âowyn as not being as progressive as this because she goes from shield maiden to housewife so to speak, but I‚Äôve never really seen that as a negative thing. I can‚Äôt recall where I read (or heard? it might‚Äôve been a recorded piece) this, but someone once said that Tolkien having √âowyn realize violence isn‚Äôt inherently the way to be seen as a helper or important to the cause was, in fact, not just reducing her to being Faramir‚Äôs lover. She goes on to be a healer of sorts in a way instead; instead of being seen as more masculine so as to be seen as ‚Äúimportant‚Äù or ‚Äúvital,‚Äù she realizes she can retain more feminine aspects and still fill those roles. Now I‚Äôm not sure if I explained this well enough‚Äîit‚Äôs been a bit since I‚Äôve read or seen the movies‚Äî, but I also wanted to add in The Two Towers films when she‚Äôs practising with her blade and Aragorn catches hers with his own sword and the dialogue that‚Äôs transferred between them: he recognizes her as being both talented with a sword, but also that she‚Äôs his equal. He doesn‚Äôt do this in a demeaning way either; he‚Äôs casual and gentle in his telling her this, like it‚Äôs not some sudden realization he‚Äôs come to, he‚Äôs been knew this, and I think the shock on her face helps with this argument. She doesn‚Äôt need to be stoic and violent or war-torn to be seen as a leader nor progressive, much like men themselves. She can still be seen as vulnerable, able to cry, etc. I sometimes think there‚Äôs this weird thinking that traditional femininity might been seen as docile or submissive and not modern, etc, but it‚Äôs kinda counterproductive in way. I‚Äôve always loved this aspect of her character, this realization that she doesn‚Äôt need to prove herself in any way. I just wanted to know if anyone else thought like this or had better points to add. Of course, do I think Tolkien is super great with all the female characters? Not necessarily‚Äîsure there aren‚Äôt much that have many very active roles in the series and most aren‚Äôt there on their own account (that is, they‚Äôre more so just helping the story move on for the lead characters), but part of me always ‚Äúblamed‚Äù that on his own experiences from the war and such. A male dominated world of violence. I imagine most women were more so in the medical field, at least during that period in time, and I think Tolkien making √âowyn more of that kind of character is his way of saying they‚Äôre just as vital and important to the story, no matter how subtle their actions are to others and their perceptions.

2103,lotr,"Reading LOTR for the first time, and I just went through the part in the beginning, Shadows of the Past, where Gandalf explains his long research on Bilbo‚Äôs ring, searching for Golem, etc.

Gandalf says that the test in the fire is enough on its own to prove it‚Äôs the One Ring. My question is, when did Gandalf first become seriously concerned that Bilbo‚Äôs ring was this ring? Because it seems pretty early on, even at Bilbo‚Äôs 111th birthday or not long after.

It‚Äôs hard for me to fathom why Gandalf would spend all those years investigating when a simple test could be done. Yes it‚Äôs Bilbo‚Äôs property, but considering Gandalf‚Äôs degree of concern, exhibited by his long devoted investigation, and considering the weight of the issue if it IS the One Ring, I just don‚Äôt get why he waited until he was 99% positive.

When I read it, it seemed comical. Especially since he said, ‚ÄúI spoke with Gollum, which is the reasonable thing to do if you can.‚Äù (Paraphrase.) And also that his greatest error was giving up the search for Gollum for a while. No Gandalf, I don‚Äôt think that was your greatest error.

Did Tolkien mean for this to be funny? What am I missing?",Why didn‚Äôt Gandalf test Bilbo‚Äôs ring in the fire much earlier?

2141,lotr,"I‚Äôm referring to the paths of the dead. 

For those of you who may not remember, in the books Aragon rides along this passage with the Grey Company, calls the spirits to the stone of Erech, reveals himself as Isildur‚Äôs heir and calls them to their oath. They then follow him to confront the Corsair ships. 

The whole section is fantastically written. There is a very palpable sense of dread as the ghosts are described only as a shadowy malice following close behind Aragon and his company, they are never clearly described, and there is never any direct interaction between Aragorn and the ghosts. Just an evil presence that stalks their passing through this sinister land along with one disembodied fell voice that calls out to them at one point. 

Finally when they meet the corsairs they don‚Äôt really do anything. The fact that this dark host of shadowy figures rode alongside Aragorn lead the corsairs to believe some king of the dead was assailing them so they jumped into the Anduin and fled, allowing the grey company to take their ships and the dead to pass on after fulfilling their oath to face Gondor‚Äôs enemies. 

I understand that the grey company were cut because they could be without it damaging the story too much, and some excess had to be trimmed from somewhere to fit these epics into an already long runtime. This meant that Aragorn couldn‚Äôt turn up to help break Gondor‚Äôs siege empty handed so his ghost army had to come too, and they had to be able to actually do something. I get it and I don‚Äôt hate it. It just seems very cartoon-y in comparison to their role in the books.

One of the most foreboding and tense sections in ROTK is soured by Gimli blowing at ghost smoke hands and cringing at the crunching of skulls under his feet. The Host aren‚Äôt some shadowy dark presence but a literal green army of ghosts, that have a very cheesy conversation with Aragorn before a fake-out departure, some inserted explosions and forced drama of the cave collapse and then a swift return to agree to fight.  

From an otherwise fairly faithful adaptation at key sections this departure from the source material is very strong and stinks of ‚Äúhollywood‚Äù rather than the subtlety of Tolkien‚Äôs writing. 

This is worst of all when they arrive at The Pelenor Fields and become this Deus ex machina where they sweep over the battleground in this huge green wave and comically swarm the Oliphants like ants and bring them down. 

Again, I understand, in the books the battle for Gondor wages for days after Aragorn‚Äôs arrival. Literally everyone important leaves the front lines but it rages on for some time after. In the movies they had to wrap that section up so they could progress the story. 

But man, on re-reading the chapters of the paths of the dead, and the siege of Gondor, I just wish there was a better way to do that than ‚Äúmagic ghost army kills the entire army so Gondor is safe now‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm not hating on the films, I still love them, I just think the way they handled this could have been better. What do you guys think?","As a great lover of both the films and the books, upon a recent re-read I have come to dislike the film portrayal of one particular part of the story."

2151,lotr,"I recently watched the movies (both Hobbit and LOTR) for the first time ever, and I went into them with absolutely no Middle Earth knowledge other than knowing about the existence of Gollum, Bilbo, and Frodo (and I knew nothing about them I just knew their names). Anyway, I loved the movies so much and I am now planning on reading all of the books. The characters, the scenery, the score, everything was so good! And while watching the movies I always found myself looking forward to the scenes of Frodo and Sam (not to say the other scenes weren't fantastic), and I realized that Frodo is absolutely my favorite character. I don't know why, I was just really interested in him and I wanted to learn more about him.

So after watching the movies I went to youtube and reddit just to see what the fans think about everything, and I noticed a lot of people don't like Frodo. I saw a lot of people not liking the movie version, saying he seemed too weak or wimpy and that he was too young, and a lot of other things. And I know apparently book Frodo is stronger or at least more courageous but to be honest I also really liked the way he was portrayed in the movies. He was living in the Shire most of his life, and like all of the other hobbits he didn't go on any adventures or anything, only hearing about them through Bilbo's stories. Then suddenly he has this extremely difficult task to deal with and I honestly wouldn't expect most people to take that kind of quest easily. Plus the ring was putting him through so much, it was basically pure evil and I don't think anyone would ever be able to relate to what he was going through with it. And for the too young thing, I know he's 33 throughout the movie but that's the coming of age year for hobbits so it's kinda like 18 in human years. I also know he's actually 50 in the book however he did have the ring so I'd imagine he would still look the same as he did in the movie because the ring makes aging a lot slower.

So now that my thoughts on the movie Frodo are out of the way, I also want to say that I've seen people not liking Frodo both in the movies and books. And I haven't read the books yet so I just want to know why people don't like him even from the books? And if there's anything I'm incorrect about with my thoughts on movie Frodo, definitely let me know! Or if you want to share your thoughts on movie Frodo, please feel free to do so, I just want to see everybody's opinions.",Why is Frodo so disliked?

""Why did all these races of people just accept some random dude gave them powerful rings without thinking he made one for himself? Why are the rings actually powerful? What, the ring only makes them invisible, so whats the problem if Sauron gets it? Why is Sauron just now attacking after all these years? If Gandalf is a wizard and can use spells like he did with his fight against Sauroman, then why does he need a sword sometimes? Why do dwarves and elfs hate each other? Why didn't those wraith things attack the group when they went into the mines and when Frodo and Sam left the group after the first movie? Why is the fact a girl killed the Wraith a big deal? Why is the king of Gordon exiled?""

2157,lotr,,I'm fairly sure this door is actually a Nazgul.
2158,lotr,"for many years I had always thought the scene was a load of crap because I was always told that it would simply be impossible for him to go toe to toe against Gandalf. And so I believed it. I still enjoy the scene, its very well done, but in my head its just nonsense. 

BUT LO AND BEHOLD!! Imagine my surprise when I come across the ACTUAL passage in the book describing this EXACT scene. ill post the actual passage in the comments, but as far as imp concerned, unlikely as it would be, I don't think the movie scene is nearly as ridiculous as people make it out to be. 

I really don't think the Witch King, the strongest of the Nazgul, and right hand man to Sauron himself, the greatest evil since Morgoth, would take a fight against Gandalf the White, if he didn't think he could win. And we see exactly this in the books. He strolls up, with every confidence that he will be victorious, is seconds from having a duel with Gandalf, and is suddenly forced to concentrate his attention on the arriving Rohan army. 

So we don't even know how this fight would end. We NEVER see it happen. And so i find it so perplexing that people vehemently reject any and all ideas of Gandalf losing. 

If we are to assume that the Nazgul's strength is directly tied to that of Sauron, given that when he lost his physical form so did the nine, and we are told Sauron is getting stronger as the days go by, does it not sound reasonable that Peter Jacksons interpretation of this scene favors the WK? The book leaves it up in the air. 

Personally I believe it would be a VERY close fight, and ultimately to me Gandalf would win, but I also don't reject PJ's scene either. If you believe Gandalf would mop the floor with him, its a valid point of view.

But how can you so readily just assume the scene from the movie is false in every way?","why does the scene in the films, when Gandalf and the Witch king face off, get so much criticism when we don't actually know what would have happened?"

For example, when they entered Mirkwood he told me ""Oh, this is where Bombur falls into the river"". Then when they saw the lights, he interrupted ""Oh, this is where they try to get food from the elves, but then get lost, and Bilbo has to save them from the spiders"" and so on so forth. I'm happy to find that he understood more the first time then I had guessed, and I hope he understand more this time too.

I thought to try to push into Fellowship next, then if it proves too much for him I'll pause and do something else for awhile. Maybe finish the Oz books.

At any rate, I'm looking for some suggestions for other LotR material to get him. I was considering one of the atlases so he can see more of the maps (He loves the two maps in the Hobbit hardcover). And specific book or edition I should look for?

Also he likes the dwarf ruins. I was also thinking of a book of paintings, if there is such a thing, so he can get some images of the various characters.

I'm new to this legendary book series. I watched Lord of the Rings - The  Fellowship of the Rings for the 1st time in 2007 and I was utterly marvelled by the movie as 12 years old. but I was unlucky and didn't know there's more to the series. I  watched LOTR- Two Towers and Return of the King in 2010 yet still had no clues about the book series. (well  poor me I must've lived under a rock) still, I watched Lord of the Rings movies as a religion because they never stopped giving me goosebumps every time I watched them. In 2016 I watched The hobbit series and they got added to my religious movie series as favourites. somehow I came across the ""Men of the West"" youtube channel week ago and found out about the whole book series. (I'm a frog living in the well so forgive me). due to Covid I can't buy printed books online and there is none in my country so far as I searched. so I'm sweeping net to find the books and found few books to read online.

1. so my question is which one I should start reading first? (because I  saw a  lot of comments saying ""Silmarillion"" is a bit hard to understand for  beginners )
2. any  readers who can answer my questions about the series tell me everything  they know and become a friend to chat (I'm 25 now but I'm still lost  and at least now I want to move and live in the Middle earth)
3. Is there changes in printing edition's in books?

One thing that sort of sticks out to me is, in Two Towers, when Frodo is in Osgiliath, he literally shows the ring to the witch king before Sam interrupts. Why did the witch king just fly off instead of like actually going hard/climbing down etc?  


Afterwards, in Return of the King, after Pipping uses the palantir, they say that Sauron believes Pippin has the ring, hence why he had to leave.  


Surely if that ***was*** true, did the witch king and Sauron not communicate? Please correct me if I'm missing something but it seems weird for them to assume Pippin has the ring when they literally saw Frodo with it.  


Also, during the battle at minas tirith, when the witch king confronted Gandalf and Pippin, why did he not finish him off instead of just flying off?",Q: Why didn't they go hard on Osgiliath and why did they think Pippin had the ring?

Just out of curiosity, are we certain these 4K‚Äôs are made from a fresh scan of the negatives? Most of the reviews I‚Äôve read say they are but then people are posting ‚Äòevidence‚Äô of it being an upscale from the same master for the Blu-rays.

Also, how bad is the DNR actually? I‚Äôm not particularly fastidious about it as some people seem to be. 

I haven‚Äôt seen the new ones yet so I‚Äôm curious to hear from those who have. In any case, I can‚Äôt imagine these being worse than the Blu-rays.

Cheers all",Some questions regarding the 4K‚Äôs
2314,lotr,"I know I certainly do, but I admit that I often feel heavily outnumbered in this regard. Depending on where you look, sometimes the internet will hit you with a narrative that suggests that the Extended Editions are the only true editions worth watching. 

As someone (like many of you) who has grown up with The Lord of the Rings films for close to two decades now, and as someone who has seen both versions multiple times, I have come to the conclusion that the theatrical editions are the superior films. 

In the end of the day, it‚Äôs all down to personal preference, and I respect anyone‚Äôs opinion on this. What I can‚Äôt quite grasp is why the theatrical editions are so regularly dismissed. What I especially struggle to grasp is why so many people are determined to place the extended editions on a much higher pedestal. 

For mine, the biggest problem with the extended editions is the pacing. It‚Äôs not just the fact that they‚Äôre longer (runtime isn‚Äôt the issue), but the editing and momentum is often completely out of whack. Additional scenes often feel awkwardly out of place, and they tend to detract from the main focus of the story. Some additional scenes even completely kill the transitional flow of one scene to another. 

This[This](https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/homebodymovies.com/2018/01/12/lord-of-the-rings-extended-vs-theatrical/amp/) article covers my sentiments pretty well and I feel that it presents some valid points. It‚Äôs an interesting read and I certainly encourage you to give it a shot before commenting.

I‚Äôm eager to see how many people agree with me, and if not, what is it about the extended editions that you believe makes them the better films?",How Many People Here Prefer the Theatrical Cuts of the Films?
2315,lotr,"I felt the movies we got were just done very poorly and focused on strange parts of the book while ignoring others. The first movie is pretty decent, though it really should have set up Thorin as having the capacity for evil. The second movie is a total disaster, it used Beorn as a scary encounter never to be seen again instead of a cheerful and recurring character, it basically skipped anything in the forest, and then it gave us terrible scenes in Mirkwood and introduced unnecessary characters and storylines. And then! Laketown!! What a disaster!! And then we go into the mountain, which is fun... until it's an hour later and you just want the movie to end. And then there's the third movie for which there are no rules and they give up on everything.

I understand the ideas behind stretching the movie, but they were just all wrong. I'd have made Thorin less heroic, done Mirkwood like in the book, if you're going to have Thranduil reveal he keeps his face looking good through magic at least have him also reveal the castle is actually in ruins and being kept looking good through magic as well - you know, try and develop a recurring theme that you can pay off in the third movie (or just don't do any of that). But the second movie's length shouldn't come from weird lengthy scenes in the mountain or in a weird Laketown or barrel escaping, if you're up for enriching the story then give us Gandalf and Saruman expelling the Necromancer. You can show why Gandalf respects Saruman, you can lay the groundwork for Saruman being evil, and best of all you can put the action burden on naturally action scene instead of forcing it into other parts of the story. It's what they did in The Two Towers. And the second movie should end with the dragon escaping, no 40 minute chase scene, just the Dwarves very happy to have their home and gold back, refusing to listen or care, Bilbo running to Thorin for help, Thorin refusing to help, Bilbo running outside and saying his line, although making it ""what have I done"" and giving some personal responsibility that he has to fix in the third movie. And then your third movie can have Bilbo going between two or even three antagonists before your big action scene in the middle and you tidy end back in the Shire. Plus, here you can have Thorin's death be as a part of a redemption arc, and not part of a ""always good guy is still good"" straight line. And chop that runtime down to under 120 minutes.

I'm just rambling and it is late at night, but I hate the ""The Hobbit should be one movie"" attitude. Sure, it could be one movie, but it could be three movies. Just because these were done wrong doesn't mean it can't be a trilogy.","I still genuinely think you could have made a Hobbit movie trilogy, despite the failures of what we got."

The rules will follow those of Survivor where every round a player is voted out, and when only 2 people remain, those voted out in turn vote for the winner. (Here's a 1 minute explanation of the whole process: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1-hTpG_krk)

The game will be hosted on a private forum willed with Middle Earth theming, characters, references and fun Easter eggs for you to pick up on. Everyone will play as someone from LotR and compete in challenges drawn from events in the series. Otherwise it will mostly involve messaging the other characters using an e-mail like system to befriend them, strategise and decide the vote.

Contestants are free to play however they wish, at any level of involvement. You can focus heavily on the role-playing aspect of the characters or focus on the social-strategy, or anything in between - it's entirely up to you. The only thing to keep in mind is that your success largely depends on how the others in your tribe view your style and level of engagement, and how well you are able to adapt.

It lasts roughly 3-4 weeks (with weekends off) starting from January 10 and can be played from any time zone. Although some events will be hosted live (such as Tribal Council, the ceremony before the vote takes places), attendance is optional as you can also cast your votes in advance.

Participation is also anonymous for the duration of the game, in order to keep everything fair. So while I'm eager to answer any general questions in the comments here (and can point you to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineSurvivor/comments/k3isrb/lord_of_the_rings_forumbased_org_now_casting/) written for Survivor fans), I'd ask anyone interested in signing up to please send me a private message. And then we can discuss all the details including who you would like to play as. :)",Join an online LotR game!

2354,lotr,"In  a documentary entitled ""A Study Of The Maker Of Middle-Earth""   Christopher Tolkien (1924 - 2020) has proposed an insightful  interpretation to the One  Ring. Any video game writer - as any Tolkien  scholar - should be highly  interested in it:

&gt;(...)  in his (Tolkien's - n.n.) secondary world, the Machine is - as he   would say - mythologized... in the mythological mode, because he is   dealing, entirely, in the representation of his perception of the   primary world in the secondary world form (‚Ä¶) well if you like, the   Middle Earth. And, I think, **it  is undoubtedly true that in this very  large sense of the word  ""Machine""....the supreme Machine, in the  mythological terms, is the  Ring**! **Is the one Ring**!  This of course, makes  him extraordinary because maybe if you would  feel like saying 'Yes, but  surely, the Ring is the most Magic think of  all!' To which he would say,  'The Magic is very closed to the Machine!'  Magic is coercion, is the  coercion of the world! The attempt by  operators to transform the world!  And ended, the Elves, as he again  said and saying on the same largely  drawing on what of himself did and  put it to my way‚Ä¶the Elves represent,  obviously they represent in the  sense of aspect, they must do, of  the‚Ä¶the Human! They represent an  aspect of the Man-kind but raised in a  certain direction, to a higher  power.....with powers that meant actually  possess.....and the ultimate  aim of the Elves, is art and not power!  Whereas Man have taking the  solution of...of Power, representing by  Machine....the Ring is the  ultimate Machine, because it was made for  coercion! Made by Sauron to  coerce! And that is why the only solution to  the problem of the Ring,  as the why they driven their sword, was...its  destruction!","The ring, the magic and the machine: Christopher Tolkien about the deepest meaning of the supreme ring."
2355,lotr,,This makes no sense if you haven't watched BB I'm afraid
2356,lotr,"This may be an unpopular opinion, but I'll be honest, I actually have a bit of a soft spot for Sauron. That's not to say he's in any way a good guy, but I do really enjoy his character, and I'd consider him (possibly) the most interesting villain in the Legendarium. Which is pretty nuts when we consider that he only has the *most* limited appearance on the pages of *The Lord of the Rings,* despite the fact that he *is* the titular Lord of said rings. The problem is that by the Third Age, Sauron was  just a (metaphorical) shadow of his former self, and by the time of the more recognisable elements in the Legendarium such as Gondor, Hobbits, and the Wizards, Sauron's most interesting days are behind him. So today I want to chronicle the Ages of Arda from the perspective of Sauron, and try to explain what makes *The Deceiver* such a great character. 

Now Sauron is a being with many many names, and way back in the beginning, no one would have thought to call him Sauron. You see what Sauron actually means in the Quenya language of the Elves is *""the abhorred""*, and so this name was used only *after* his fall into darkness. However in *The Silmarillion* his original name is never given, and when *Morgoth's Ring* was published 17 years later, all we're told is that Sauron was what he was ""*afterwards called.""* So what was his original name? Well it wasn't until 2007 that this question was finally answered. So in the 17th issue of the *Parma Eldarlamberon,* which is a book of Elven Tongues concerning names and words from Tolkien's fictional languages, which was written by the Professor in the 1950s but not published until *way* more recently, we're told that Sauron's original name was *Mairon*. Which means ""*the Admirable.""* And this is key to understanding Sauron's character. 

Because back in the beginning Sauron was not a creature of darkness. He was in fact the complete opposite.

Right at the beginning, before the universe was even made, Eru Il√∫vatar (God with a capital G) created the Ainur, *""the Holy Ones, that were the offspring of his thought.""* Now the mightiest of all the Ainur was Melkor, and he was destined to become the first Dark Lord. And to be honest, in my opinion, Melkor absolutely sucks. After him, the fourteen most powerful Ainur are known as the Valar, and in some ways they're kind of similar to a pantheon of gods and goddesses (with a little g). And the rest of the Ainur are known as Maiar, sort of like angels or demi-gods. And one of these Maiar was Mairon. And unlike most other dark Maiar such as the balrogs, Mairon was not originally a follower of Melkor. Instead he was a pupil of Aul√´, the Vala of crafting.

And this is also very important to Sauron's character. Because, if for a moment we remove all the ethics and all the morality from him, at his core, Sauron is the greatest craftsman ever to live in Middle-earth. And this love of crafting is central to his purpose and motivation. It's very important to note that whereas Melkor turned to evil out of a jealous desire to bring about discord, ruin, and dominion, Sauron's motives are much more understandable. Mairon was a lover of order and perfection. And as the greatest of the Maiar, he believed himself worthy of ruling Middle-earth and crafting his vision of a world without waste or turmoil. Now as is so often the case with geniuses, this desire soon turned to obsession, and before long, Mairon found himself admiring Melkor's power ""*to effect his designs quickly and masterfully.""* And thus Mairon was corrupted into Sauron, and *""for long he served another and not himself.""*

Now in order to keep this story moving, I'm going to have to skip forward tens of thousands of years, to the moment where Melkor is defeated and imprisoned by the Valar, after the War for the Sake of the Elves. So for three long ages, (which with a bit of Tolkien maths we can calculate as 2874.6 years as we'd reckon it), Melkor is locked away in the West, but Sauron is not locked away with him. Instead Sauron simply remains in Middle-earth, and he spends these long ages faithfully rebuilding Melkor's armies and awaiting his master's eventual return. And in this time we can speculate that Sauron may have given some thought to the future, and to the perfectly ordered world that he hoped to build with Melkor. 

But this is not what happened. When Melkor eventually did return to Middle-earth, he was angrier, pettier, and more bitter than ever before. And instead of crafting Middle-earth into a perfectly ordered kingdom, he simply wanted to pollute, ruin, and pervert everything that the Elves and the Valar had built. His goal was to corrupt Middle-earth into something obscene. And I imagine this must have struck a sour chord with Sauron. But still, Sauron remained faithful to his master. 

Now throughout the First Age of the Sun, Sauron became Melkor's chief disciple, and along with the Lord of the Balrogs, Gothmog, he was the Dark Lord's highest ranked servant. But unlike Gothmog, Sauron was no warrior. In fact in the entire Legendarium, he only wins one single fight. However it's at this time that we get some more of Sauron's many names. Because among the Sindar Elves of Beleriand, legend told of a dark sorcerer known only as *Gorthaur the Cruel* (Gorthaur means terrible dread in Sindarin), and this sorcerer turned out to be of course...Sauron. 

So Gorthaur did a lot of terrible things, and he killed a lot of innocent people, and it's at this early point that he seemed to develop a bit of a chip on his shoulder in regards to Men. You see, Melkor's great enemy were the Elves, but even in the First Age, Sauron developed a particular disdain for Men, and he desired to rule them all. This will be important later. Now Sauron's great claim to fame in the First Age comes with the tale of Beren and L√∫thien. And I don't want to spoil specifics, but just before this story, Sauron invaded the Elven island of *Tol Sirion*, and he renamed it *Tol-in-Gaurhoth - the Island of Werewolves.* And it was this island that both Beren and L√∫thien came to. But to be honest, this is not Sauron's finest hour. I mean to be fair, he did defeat Galadriel's older brother in a magical battle of music, he imprisoned Beren in a werewolf infested dungeon, and he also found himself in possession of the Ring of Barahir at this time, which I like to imagine sparked some sort of curiosity of his own in regards to forging magical rings in the future. But ultimately Sauron was utterly defeated when L√∫thien and her faithful hound came to rescue her lover. 

And this is the last that we see of Sauron for hundreds of years. He fled from Tol-in-Gaurhoth, and we can presume he returned to his master Melkor, but he does nothing else for the rest of the First Age. And I have to speculate that things did not go well for Sauron when he returned to his master. His failure to kill Beren and L√∫thien ultimately began a chain of events that ended with the eventual destruction and defeat of Melkor. And I imagine Sauron was severely punished for his failings. In fact, I would speculate that during this time, Sauron may have begun to grow resentful of Melkor, and it may have entered his mind that *he* would make a far better Dark Lord. 

Anyway, the next time that we see Sauron is after the defeat of Melkor in the War of Wrath. Now this was a devastating war in which the Valar basically destroyed the region of Beleriand in order to banish Melkor into the void. And so when Sauron returns to the story, he doesn't do so as a servant of darkness, but instead in a fair and repentant form. In fact Sauron even approached a dude called E√∂nw√´ (the highest-ranking Maia of them all) and he begged forgiveness and pardon. However forgiveness was not E√∂nw√´'s to give. Sauron was told that if he truly wanted forgiveness, he must kneel before the Valar and accept whatever punishment they deem worthy. But for Sauron this was simply too great a humiliation, and instead of facing his due judgement, he fled far into the South East. 

Now we can speculate for days as to whether Sauron was genuine in his repentance or not, but either way it doesn't really matter. Because by the time that the Second Age began, Sauron had relapsed into a being of darkness once more. Except this time, he was done acting as the servant of another. 

So with Melkor (and all of Beleriand) gone, Middle-earth entered its Second Age, and this is the Age in which Sauron really came into his own. But he took his sweet time in doing so. For the first 500 years, Elves and Men lived together in peace without any interference from a Dark Lord. Gil-galad was the High King of the Noldorin Elves, and Elrond's brother became the High King of the Men of N√∫menor. Again, N√∫menor will be an important part of what comes next. 

So remember how I said that Sauron fled into the South East? Well it's there that he founded the lands of Mordor, and began to corrupt many southeasterly men from Harad and Rh√ªn into his service. But unlike his later incarnations, Sauron was not yet openly committed to evil. After all, if there's one thing that's true about Sauron, it's that he is the deceiver. 

So by the year 1200 of the Second Age, the Elves of Eregion had become some of the finest craftsmen in Middle-earth. And under the command of their lord Celebrimbor, a brotherhood of Elven jewel smiths founded the *Gwaith-i-M√≠rdain,* which began creating objects of exquisite power and beauty. And it was at this time, that a divine and angelic being came to Eregion. His origins were a mystery but he introduced himself as *Annatar - The Lord of Gifts.* 

Now I doubt it will come as too much of a spoiler that of course Annatar's secret identity is in fact Sauron. And Sauron had not forgotten his ambition to craft Middle-earth into his warped version of a perfect world. Now I've found that when one Google searches images of Annatar he's often portrayed as an evil looking elf, but this is not the case at all. Annatar was astoundingly fair to look upon, and no one but the few absolute wisest beings in Middle-earth had any reason to mistrust him. And unfortunately for the Gwaith-i-M√≠rdain, Celebrimbor was not one of these few. 

So Annatar taught the Elves of Eregion how to forge Rings of Power, and together they created the first sixteen rings that would one day be split into the Nine and the Seven. But in secret, Celebrimbor forged three rings of his own, and Sauron had no hand in their creation. These are of course the Elven rings, and this is actually the reason why Sauron isn't able to dominate the Elven ring-bearers in the same way he dominates the nine Men into his Nazg√ªl. But we all know that Celebrimbor wasn't the only one to forge rings in secret. And in the fires of the Sammath Naur, better known as the Cracks of Doom, Sauron forged the One Ring. 

Now, I don't want to go making excuses for Sauron. He was a bad guy. But I do believe that if the Elves of Eregion had willingly joined with Annatar at this point, and submitted themselves to the power of his Ruling Ring, then all the ugliness that followed may not have had to occur. But of course it did occur. Because the moment that Sauron put on his Ring in Mordor, hundreds of miles away, Celebrimbor sensed his evil, and the days of trusting Annatar came to an abrupt end. 

So what follows is known as the War of the Elves and Sauron, and I won't go into specifics, or else this post would be 10,000 words long, but I have to say that it ends particularly horribly for Celebrimbor. His body is shot with arrows, impaled on a spike, and then carried around by Orcs as their war banner. But Celebrimbor's sacrifice is not for nothing. Although Sauron does successfully reclaim the original sixteen Rings of Power, Celebrimbor sends the Three far away, and Sauron never gets his hands on them. Now this war is long and bloody, but as is so often the case with Sauron, he actually loses pretty much every single battle. You see, although Sauron more-or-less defeated the Elves, he was in turn defeated by a great army of Men from N√∫menor who came to the Elves' aid. And I think this really cemented Sauron's hatred of Men forever. 

However despite the fact that Sauron lost the war, over the next few thousand years, he came to dominate almost all of Middle-earth. Slowly his power spread, and the way he did this demonstrates how Sauron is much better suited to political influence than he is to military might. Despite magnificently losing the war, by the 1800s of the Second Age, Sauron was worshiped by almost all Men in Middle-earth. During the following Dark Years, Sauron revealed his Nazg√ªl for the first time, corrupted the inhabitants of southern Middle-earth, and he (probably) burned the Entwives alive in their gardens (which is arguably the worst thing he ever does). In fact the only three places in Middle-earth that were really able to resist Sauron were the Elven refuges of Lindon, Rivendell, and Lothl√≥rien.  And during these long years where Sauron ruled, he even declared himself the Lord of the Earth, and the King of Men. But that turned out to be a mistake. 

You see N√∫menor was not a part of Sauron's empire. It was an island nation that existed far from Sauron's influence in Middle-earth. And N√∫menor was the realm of the most powerful Men ever to exist in the Legendarium. So the King of N√∫menor did *not* appreciate Sauron declaring himself the King of Men. And in his arrogance the King of N√∫menor, who's name was Pharaz√¥n, decided he would declare war on the Dark Lord and teach him who the true King of Men really was.

And this is pretty much what happened. Pharaz√¥n mustered a fleet and an army. He sailed to Middle-earth, and he marched right up to the the Black Gate of Mordor. And just to give you an idea of how mighty the N√∫menorean army truly was, not a single living thing stood in there way throughout their entire march. When they finally did arrive outside Mordor, they were ready to slay every orc and troll that they found inside. But no battle ever happened. Instead Sauron himself came out to meet Pharaz√¥n and his army, and immediately, Sauron knelt, and surrendered himself to be taken as Pharaz√¥n's prisoner. And so the Dark Lord was taken to N√∫menor in chains.

Now I would argue that this next part of the tale, is one of the most interesting stories that Professor Tolkien ever wrote. Because Sauron came to N√∫menor as a hostage, but only 57 years later, he was responsible for wiping N√∫menor off the map forever! 

So in order to fully understand this, we need a brief overview of N√∫menor's history. 3000 years ago, back at the beginning of the Second Age, N√∫menor was was the most wonderful place. It was governed by great kings who ruled for hundreds of years and lived in peace and harmony with the Elves of Middle-earth. *And* with the Elves of the West. But this didn't last. Over the millennia, a shadow fell upon N√∫menor. You see when their island was first brought out of the sea, it was a gift from Eru Il√∫vatar. But there was one rule. The N√∫menoreans were allowed to sail wherever they wanted, but they could not sail West. They could not sail to the Undying Lands. And in time, the Men of N√∫menor began to resent this rule. They began to resent their mortality which they viewed as a curse. Their relation with the Elves turned to hatred, and by the time of Pharaz√¥n, the Kings of N√∫menor considered themselves enemies of the West and enemies of the Valar. Now all of this is great news for Sauron!

Because, as I've said a few times already, Sauron was the deceiver. He couldn't destroy the Men of N√∫menor with orcs and trolls, but he could deceive them into destroying themselves. And this is exactly what he did. So in the span of only a few years, Sauron went from Pharaz√¥n's prisoner to his chief advisor. And he did so by playing on Pharaz√¥n's fear of mortality. The older the king grew, and the closer to death that he came, the more he relied upon Sauron. And the greater Sauron's influence over N√∫menor extended. And Sauron knew exactly what lies to tell the king. 

He told Pharaz√¥n a story. He told Pharaz√¥n lies about the Valar. And he told Pharaz√¥n about the one being who who was powerful enough to fight them. Melkor. *""The Giver of Freedom.""* So for the second time in his life, Sauron became Melkor's Chief Disciple, although this time I believe it was all a deception. Sauron promised the king that by turning from Eru Il√∫vatar and worshiping Melkor instead, the secrets of immortality would be revealed to him. And Pharaz√¥n believed every word. 

As the years went on, Sauron became the de facto ruler of N√∫menor *""from behind the throne"",* and he adopted his old name from eons ago. *Tar-Mairon - King Excellent.* Although I should clarify that the N√∫menoreans never used this Elven name because they hatred the Elven language, and so in Ad√ªnaic (the language of the N√ªmenoreans) Sauron was known as Zig√ªr, which means the Wise One. 

Now Sauron's rule in N√∫menor was brutal, and he made the worship of Melkor into the official state religion. A great black temple was constructed in the nation's capital, and inside there was a black seat for Sauron and a great fiery altar. Upon this altar The White Tree of N√∫menor was burned to ashes, and when that was done, the Kingsmen of N√∫menor turned to human sacrifice. Only a small number of Faithful N√∫menoreans refused to betray the Valar, and many of these were murdered in Sauron's temple. It was hoped that their bloody offerings would free Pharaz√¥n from his fated death. But it didn't work. 

In the end, Sauron told the King that there was only one way to achieve immortality. He must take it through conquest. And so, Sauron convinced Pharaz√¥n to build a great armament of ships, and to sail West. To declare war upon the Valar. 

And so *that* is how Sauron wiped N√∫menor from existence. When the first of Pharaz√¥n's ships landed on the Undying Lands, Eru Il√∫vatar himself intervened, and he changed the shape of the world, so that no Men could ever again sail into the West again. And in this cataclysm, the Kingsmen were destroyed. N√∫menor was obliterated, and not unlike the legend of Atlantis, it was lost beneath the waves. Now ironically Pharaz√¥n actually got his wish. He was buried alive *""under falling hills,""* and there he will remain for countless millennia, in the Cave of the Forgotten, *""until the Last Battle and the Day of Doom"".*

However as it goes, Sauron himself was also utterly destroyed when N√∫menor fell. But he wasn't gone. He had the One Ring, and so although his body was lost, his essence survived, and in time he was able to rebuild. 

And this pretty much catches us up to the story of Sauron that we're all familiar with. Only 111 years later, the surviving Faithful N√∫menoreans, under their new High King Elendil, made a Last Alliance with the Noldor's High King Gil-galad. And after ten years of war the two High Kings eventually defeated Sauron in one on one (or I guess two on one) combat. However they gave their lives to do so. And as I'm sure everyone here knows, Sauron was eventually defeated when Elendil's son took up his father's broken blade, and cut the ring from Sauron's vanquished hand. 

Now we all know that this isn't the end of Sauron's story. His malice endured throughout all of the Third Age, but his days as the deceiver were over. Never again would he be the Lord of the Earth. And to be honest, I feel that Sauron in the Third Age is but a shade of who he'd been before. By the time of the Lord of the Rings, he was a tyrant and a lord of evil, but he wasn't really much more than that. He was a far cry from Tar-Mairon. A far cry from the admired Maia spirit who'd had so much potential so long ago. 

Sauron wanted to rule a perfect world, but in the end, the deceiver was deceived by his own warped sense of virtue. Perhaps the thing to take away from Sauron's story is the danger of believing that perfection can be forced through dominion. Or that order can be crafted by control. 

So, thank you all very much for reading this, I'd love to hear your thoughts and comments on one of Middle-earth's finest villains. As some of you may already know, I've been working on a series of YouTube videos about Tolkien's Legendarium. The series is called *Tolkien Untangled*, and there are plenty of video essays like this one as well as videos explaining the Silmarillion, and the differences between the Lord of the Rings books and movies. So check out *Tolkien Untangled* on YouTube if you'd like to learn more.

The color tones are matching throughout each film for a seemless transition movie to movie. The colors are on a wider spectrum and much more real life looking on the wide panning shots when they're on their walk to Mordor.

The picture is sharp with 2k masters upscale to 4k like most older movies with a 4k remaster. Gandalf's beard has never looked more detailed.

The best part is the audio mix. The movie sounds much better in basic 5.1 Dolby Digital/ 5.1 Dolby Digital Plus than it did on the original blu rays and DVD releases. If you're fortunate enough to have a Dolby atmos soundbar or reciever set up, you are in for a treat. The 3d uncompressed audio mix is astounding, probably one of the best Dolby Atmos mixes for any movie. For the opening scene, everything Sauron does shakes my house. Every footstep is the biggest sub thump. Every sword swing sends a rumbling wave of bass throughout my house. The sound for the movie puts into perspective the sheer size and might of the main antagonist.

I am very pleased with a 4k HDR remaster of both the theatrical version and the extended version. I have only watched extended for I prefer the whole picture and I was worried the 4k remaster would only come out in theatrical, luckily Peter Jackson did not disappoint. 

Only downside of purchasing the 4k discs and possibly even the digital version on some platforms is that it does not come with bonus features like the Appendices. Luckily, if you purchase through ITunes or if you keep your Movies Anywhere code from the disc purchase, you can make an Apple ID if you don't already have one, link it to a movies anywhere account, use your code from the discs, and now you have access to all of the Lotr/Hobbit extras through AppleTV extras.

Meanwhile, you have some reviewers posting weird articles shaming the remaster.

This article baselessly says that the 4k remaster should not have been done and is subpar compared to the blurays, without adding a single point of evidence or comparison with the old versions of the films, comparing it to the likes of George Lucas' StarWars Specialized Edition (just to be clear, nothing was added or changed in Peter Jackson's 4k remaster. Only thing is rerendering of Lotr CGI because the quality did not hold up on a 4k upscale)

Overall, if you're looking for an excuse to venture back to middle earth, now is the time. You will not find a better experience of fantasy if you have a 4k TV and a decent audio setup. These movies will hopefully propel the next generation of Tolkien lovers. Definitely give it a go if you have the option to purchase them.

2401,lotr,"Disclaimer before you read. Lord of the Rings are my favorite movies of all time. I love these movies more any anything. Some of these questions are questions I‚Äôve had for many years and some can be considered to be nit picking. But I‚Äôm honestly curious if any of these questions have legitimate answers that I‚Äôm not thinking of.

Fellowship:

Bilbo uses the ring during his birthday. But when Frodo uses it in the Prancing Pony and any other time the eye of Sauron sees him. Did Sauron not see Bilbo and Gollum use the ring?

Does Frodo live with Bilbo? When Gandalf comes back to tell Frodo he must leave Frodo is coming back to Bilbo‚Äôs house.. or is it Frodo‚Äôs house too?

When Saruman lifts Gandalf to the top of Isengard how does he end up on the outside of the tower?

The famous scene of You have my sword, my bow, and my axe. Right before this scene Gimli destroys his Axe trying to destroy the ring. Did he have two axes? Lol

Frodo gets stabbed and then passed out. Then afterwards says that he‚Äôs not hurt and reveals he has Mithril? If he wasn‚Äôt hurt then why did he look so in pain and pass out?

Two Towers:

When Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli come across the riders of Rohan they give them 2 horses. We‚Äôre they riding with horses with no one on them?

Return of the King:

How come Smeagol and Deagol fall so quickly for the ring at the beginning? Seems like Frodo has more immunity than them. I know hobbits are less likely to get tempted than men but then why did Smeagol fall for the ring so fast?",After Re-Watching LOTR in 4K I have some ‚Äúplot hole‚Äù questions.

Sometimes I stare at it for hours on end, looking at the Amazon page and feeling it sap my strength. The 4k movies... I don't even have a 4k TV, or a 4k video player... but I must have them. 

Sometimes I lay awake at night, looking at reviews of the edition and stills from Reddit. I pretend like my roommate doesn't know what I'm doing, but I can tell he does. He's been my roommate through this blight, yet my heart grows cold to him - I yearn only for the smooth cardboard and sharp discs of the 4k extended edition films. 

There's a homeless guy who lives outside our apartment who seems just as into this as I am. I'm pretty sure something's taken him - he's lived quite an urban life, but I find myself drawn not only to the editions, but to him as well. I almost want to invite him inside to stare at the box on my laptop, but my roommate forbids it. I trust him for now, but the man outside... his words are alluring. He tells me to forget the collector's edition and go for the movies right now. He tempts me... 

I don't know how much longer I can continue; each step is more laborious than the last, and I no longer wish to leave my room for anything. My appetite wanes when I think of all the resplendent glory of watching Eomer and Gandalf charge into Helm's Deep in ultra HD. My thirst is quenched by stroking my screen gently, as though I can coax the film set out of my laptop and into my hands. 

Every day waiting for the collector's edition is like dragging my feet through a labyrinth of razor sharp rocks. Yet I wait, as the homeless man whispers in one ear and my roommate counsels me in the other. And I know which one shall win, if my will fails.

2438,lotr,"

First of all, she kidnapped a guy who is named Celeborn Teleporno, TELEPORNO!

Healing powers : ¬´' 'Do not let me fall!' I [Gandalf] gasped, for I felt life in me again. 'Bear me to Lothl√≥rien!'

' 'That indeed is the command of the Lady Galadriel who sent me to look for you,' he answered.

'Thus it was that I came to Caras Galadhon and found you but lately gone. I tarried there in the ageless time of that land where days bring healing not decay. Healing I found, and I was clothed in white. Counsel I gave and counsel took.¬ª - TTT

¬´Naked I was sent back - for a brief time, until my task is done."" Sent back by whom, and whence? Not by the ""gods"" whose business is only with this embodied world and its time; for he passed ""out of thought and time"". Naked is alas! unclear. It was meant just literally, ""un-clothed like a child"" (not discarnate), and so ready to receive the white robes of the highest. Galadriel's power is not divine, and his healing in Lorien is meant to be no more than physical healing and refreshment.'¬ª - Cf. Letters no. 156 (4 November 1954)

Gandalf just had an unbelievable fight with Durin's Bane for over 10 days. Gandalf died in process to slay the Balrog. You can imagine how wrecked he was even after he was sent back to life, he needed an amazing healer. From what I read in HoME it seems it wasn't merely the magic of Lothlorien that healed Gandalf, but also Galadriel's skill in healing.

Water bending : Galadriel has Nenya the Ring of Water. She may have low-key water bending power even without Nenya, she was a pupil of Lords of the Sea, and Melian. 

Air bending : She overcame the sorcery of Sauron in the Ride of Eorl with a magical mist. ¬´As they drew nearer they saw that the white mist was driving back the glooms of Dol Guldur, and soon they passed into it, riding slowly at first and warily; but under its canopy all things were lit with a clear and shadowless light, while to left and right they were guarded as it were by white walls of secrecy.

""The Lady of the Golden Wood is on our side, it seems ,‚Äù said Borondir.

""Maybe,"" said Eorl. ""But at least I will trust the wisdom of Felar√≥f. He scents no evil. His heart is high, and his weariness is healed: he strains to be given his head. So be it! For never have I had more need of secrecy and speed.""

Then Felar√≥f sprang forward, and all the host behind followed like a great wind, but in a strange silence, as if their hooves did not beat upon the ground. So they rode on, as fresh and eager as on the morning of their setting-out, during that day and the next; but at dawn of the third day they rose from their rest, and suddenly the mist was gone, and they saw that they were far out in the open lands.¬ª - UT

Telepathy and mind reading : ""I perceive the Dark Lord and know his mind, or all of his mind that concerns the Elves. And he gropes ever to see me and my thought. But still the door is closed!"" - Galadriel to Frodo

¬´And with that word she held them with her eyes, and in silence looked searchingly at each of them in turn. None save Legolas and Aragorn could long endure her glance. Sam quickly blushed and hung his head.¬ª - FotR
Even Aragorn and Legolas felt extremely tired after Galadriel searched their minds.

¬´No explanation is offered in this rapid outline of why Galadriel scorned Sauron, unless she saw through his disguise, or of why, if she did perceive his true nature¬ª - UT

One can believe she saw through his disguise with her supernatural mind powers. Another may believe she didn't trust Annatar (Sauron in disguise) because she knew Annatar lied; She knew there is so servant of Aule with the name or title 'Annatar'.

¬´From her earliest years she had a marvellous gift of insight into the minds of others, but judged them with mercy and understanding, and she withheld her goodwill from none save only F√´anor. In him she perceived a darkness that she hated and feared, though she did not perceive that the shadow of the same evil had fallen upon the minds of all the Noldor, and upon her own.¬ª - UT

¬´For they did not move or speak with mouth, looking from mind to mind; and only their shining eyes stirred and kindled as their thoughts went to and fro.¬ª - RotK, Galadriel and Elrond and Gandalf communicating telepathically.

Singing powers : ""I sang of leaves, of leaves of gold, and leaves of gold there grew: Of wind I sang, a wind there came and in the branches blew."" - FotR, Galadriel

Galadriel was a pupil of Melian for almost 500 years. Melian is the most powerful Maia in singing.

¬´when the Shadow passed, Celeborn came forth and led the host of L√≥rien over Anduin in many boats. They took Dol Guldur, and Galadriel threw down its walls and laid bare its pits, and the forest was cleansed.¬ª

Presumably Luthien and Melian taught her how to destroy a fortress with singing.

Her air bending and water bending are also by singing powers, I believe. (Nenya helped a lot too. But give Nenya to a Hobbit and you'll see he can't even protect a small house against a stupid Troll. It enhances your powers; the more powerful you are the more powerful your Ring of Power is. ¬´Three times L√≥rien had been assailed from Dol Guldur, but besides the valour of the elven people of that land, the power that dwelt there was too great for any to overcome, unless Sauron had come there himself.¬ª)

Advanced knowledge in craftsmanship and nature stuff, or as mortals put it 'magic' : ¬´She looked upon the Dwarves also with the eye of a commander, seeing in them the finest warriors to pit against the Orcs. Moreover Galadriel was a Noldo, and she had a natural sympathy with their minds and their passionate love of crafts of hand, a sympathy much greater than that found among many of the Eldar: the Dwarves were ""the Children of Aul√´,"" and Galadriel, like others of the Noldor, had been a pupil of Aul√´ [god of craftsman] and Yavanna [goddess of nature] in Valinor.¬ª - UT

""We learned not that craft from the Noldor, but from the Lords of the Sea; and the white timbers we wrought with our own hands, and the white sails were woven by our wives and our daughters."" - Olwe the grandfather of Galadriel. Ever wondered why Lorien has swan boats? 

¬´being brilliant in mind and swift in action she had early absorbed all of what she was capable of the teaching which the Valar thought fit to give the Eldar,¬ª - UT

¬´Under the leadership of these (Sindar and Noldor) they (Silvan of Lorien) became again ordered folk and increased in wisdom.¬ª

That is the leadership of Amdir and Amroth and Celeborn and Galadriel. Amdir and Amroth and Celeborn never been in the Undying Lands. They lived in Doriath in FA. They really don't know much about craftsmanship. They are wise tho.

Galadriel made Lorien into most advanced realm of TA. Some of Galadriel creations : Magical sword sheath, strongest bows, Gandalf's clothes and staff, magical cloaks, the Phial, the Mirror, magical boats, magical ropes etc.

Galadriel weaved the most magical sails for the Teleri. She passed this skill of weaving to Arwen. Arwen weaved a magical banner for Aragorn. Grandma also taught Arwen how to make Lembas bread. 

Super strength both in physical and spirit and mind :
""[Galadriel] was then of Amazon disposition and bound up her hair as a crown when taking part in athletic feats‚Äù - Tolkien Letter 348

¬´...In this he (Tolkien) emphasized the commanding stature of Galadriel already in Valinor, the equal if unlike endowments of F√´anor; and it is said here that so far from joining in F√´anor's revolt she was in every way opposed to him.¬ª - UT

¬´A queen she was of the woodland Elves, the wife of Celeborn of Doriath, yet she herself was of the Noldor and remember the Day before days in Valinor, and she was the mightiest and fairest of all the Elves that remained in Middle-earth.¬ª - the Silmarillion

¬´Her mother-name was Nerwen (‚Äòman-maiden‚Äô), and she grew to be tall beyond the measure even of the women of the Noldor [193cm]; she was strong of body, mind, and will, a match for both the loremasters and the athletes of the Eldar in the days of their youth.¬ª - UT

¬´Nor were the 'loremasters' a seperate guild of gentle scribes, soon burned by the Orks of Angband upon pyres of books. They were mostly even as F√´anor, the greatest, kings, princes and warriors, such as the valiant captains of Gondolin, or Finrod of Nargothrond and Rodothir his kinsman and steward.¬ª - [Shibboleth of F√´anor; Note 23]

¬´Even after the merciless assault upon the Teleri and the rape of their ships, though she fought fiercely against F√´anor in defence of her mother's kin, she did not turn back. Her pride was unwilling to return, a defeated suppliant for pardon; but now she burned with desire to follow F√´anor with her anger to whatever lands he might come, and to thwart him in all ways that she could.¬ª - UT

¬´To this Curun√≠r (Saruman) now assented, desiring that Sauron should be thrust from Dol Guldur, which was nigh to the River, and should have leisure to search there no longer. Therefore, for the last time, he aided the Council, and they put forth their strength; and they assailed Dol Guldur, and drove Sauron from his hold, and Mirkwood for a brief while was made wholesome again.¬ª

Seems like they attacked Dol Guldur with an army. Presumably The White Council was held in Lorien this time and it was the last time. Lorien was in footsteps of Dol Guldur. Rivendell was far away.

""I [Gandalf] ... persuaded the Council to attack Dol Guldur first, before he [Sauron] attacked Lorien. We did, and Sauron fled."" - UT, The Quest of Erebor

""It was by the devices of Saruman that we drove him [Sauron] from Dol Guldur."" - FotR, Elrond

Gandalf and Saruman could not directly attack Sauron himself; they were limited and forbidden to do that. I think here 'devices' means 'plans'. Elrond and Galadriel and maybe Celeborn led the armies and attacked Dol Guldur.
Though in HoME we see Galadriel in front of Celeborn says she loved Gandalf the most among all people that were present in the White Council. But maybe she was talking about the White Council that was held in Rivendell for few times, not the one that was held in Lorien. Or maybe Celeborn was never a member of the White Council, even when it was held in Lorien. IDK, anyways... The point is Galadriel attacked Dol Guldur with the White Council and her army.

There are many more examples; from her tolerating infinity grieves, to her crossing Helcaraxe. ¬´The fire of their hearts was young, and led by Fingolfin and his sons, and by Finrod and Galadriel, they dared to pass into the bitterest North¬ª ¬´Few of the deeds of the Noldor thereafter surpassed that desperate crossing in hardihood or woe. There Elenw√´ the wife of Turgon was lost, and many others perished also; and it was with a lessened host that Fingolfin set foot at last upon the Outer Lands.¬ª - the Silmarillion

As soon as they arrived to ME, tired and damaged, they were attacked by army of Morgoth. Galadriel must've fought there. 

I bet Galadriel was the best and strongest in Helcaraxe. Fingolfin may be stronger than her physically, but not in spirit and mind.

¬´In Sauron's final overthrow, Elves were not effectively concerned at the point of action. Legolas probably achieved least of the Nine Walkers. Galadriel, the greatest of the Eldar surviving in Middle-earth, was potent mainly in wisdom and goodness, as a director or counsellor in the struggle, unconquerable in¬†resistance¬†(especially in mind and spirit) but incapable of punitive¬†action. In her scale she had become like Manw√´ with regard to the greater total action. Manw√´, however, even after the Downfall of N√∫menor and the breaking of the old world, even in the Third Age when the Blessed Realm had been removed from the ""Circles of the World,"" was still not a mere observer. It is clearly from Valinor that the emissaries came who were called the Istari (or Wizards), and among them Gandalf, who proved to be the director and coordinator both attack and defence.¬ª - UT


Some kinda shapeshifting probably : ¬´By the arts of Felagund their own forms and faces were changed into the likeness of Orcs; and thus disguised they came far upon their northward road,¬ª
Finrod Felagund is Galadriel's brother. Galadriel was a pupil of Melian who had shapeshifting powers. Galadriel is called 'The Mistress of Magic'. If her brother can do such art/magic, she can do it even better.

Magic dancing : If Galadriel is really that genius and fast learner, then after watching Luthien dance for 500 years, she must've at least learned it to some great extent. Or maybe she had no interest in learning this skill (which I doubt it).

So yeah she has many many amazing powers, but her best power -the best power that anyone can have- is Wisdom :
¬´Galadriel was the greatest of the Noldor, except F√´anor maybe, though she was wiser than he, and her wisdom increased with the long years.¬ª - the Shibboleth of F√´anor

¬´Pride still moved her when, at the end of the Elder Days after the final overthrow of Morgoth, she refused the pardon of the Valar for all who had fought against him, and remained in Middle-earth. It was not until two long ages more had passed, when at last all that she had desired in her youth came to her hand, the Ring of Power and the dominion of Middle-earth which she had dreamed, that her wisdom was full grown and she rejected it, and passing the last test departed from Middle-earth for ever.¬ª - UT",The list of powers of Galadriel

I've been always stumbling across opinions of people who either loved the Fellowship of the Ring the most or the the Return of the King, consistently ranking the Two Towers as their least favourite. I agree with some of the criticism of the film on the ground of how it stays from the original material but I never could get the negative comparisons to others in the trilogy. I suppose it is the least consequential of the three, not starting the journey or ending it but just being a part of it but to me, it's always been the favourite.

2470,lotr,"I got the 4k remasters and wanted to share my thoughts. Overall, the extra detail and clarity is top notch. It makes Middle Earth feel even more real seeing all of the tiny little details in the clothes, weapons, and armor. That said, this comes at the detriment to many of the cg shots. I've owned the DVD, blu ray, and now 4k versions of the trilogy and with each bump up in quality, the cg sticks out more and more and looks dated. It would've been much better to redo much of the cg work to make it mesh with the newer, cleaner, and crisper images. I know PJ did touch up some of the SFX but I feel like a lot of the time it makes it feel less real. I guess you can only polish early 2000's cg so far.

Much of the colors and tints have been adjusted, and overall the 4k versions feel a bit gray and washed out. There's just not as much contrast in many scenes. Some people prefer that and I know many people complained about the greenish tint in some scenes of the blu rays. Personally, I never had an issue with it and at this point the blu rays are the most familiar to me and are what I think of when I imagine scenes. I miss the blue tones of the battle of helms deep and the oranges and reds with the balrog in moria.

All in all, in my opinion the 4k versions are super clean and clear, but a bit lifeless and the cg is definitely showing its age now. Keep in mind, LOTR is by far my all time favorite movie (I consider all 3 movies to be one movie cuz I can't pick a favorite), and I've watched them all dozens of times.

As such, where should I turn to if I'm looking to learn more about the races, histories and lore of the ""realm"" so to speak? I would also like to get to know more about the Istari's histories (previous land and former wars, etc) and their role on the Middle Earth.

Only a minute or so after Saruman's army breaches the walls, Legolas is already on 19 kills and going up +2 per 5 seconds.

On screen AFTER that count of 19, we see him make: 9 confirmed kills and 9 likely kills (arrows which are shot but we don't see the outcome - but let's face it, he doesn't exactly miss). Quite a lot of the time, the camera pans away from him when he's surrounded by Uruks, presumably killing a lot more off screen.

This leaves us with a Legolas on screen total of 37 kills. So he apparently only made 5 more kills in the entire 6? 7? 8? hours that the battle went on for throughout the night. How?",[Movie logic] How did Legolas only kill 42 Uruk-Hai at the Battle of Helm's Deep?

2582,lotr,"I read them when I was young, more than 20 years ago, and after watching the movies so much, I didn't realize how much of the books I had completely forgotten.  But after telling my kids about it, my oldest son really wanted to read them.   He's 11, really good at reading, but was worried it was too over his reading ability.  So I told him that I would read to him at night, and we could watch the movies too.  Well I was very pleased when he agreed and refused to watch the movies until their respective books were done.  We are almost done with The Two Towers, and a few moments really stuck out in my mind.  

When Gandalf fell with the Balrog, my kids were both in awe.  

When Gandalf reappeared, they were both convinced that it was Sauron until the official revelation that it was Gandalf. 

When Faramir learned Frodo had the ring, the paragraph that followed had my son immediately convinced he was corrupted, but he quickly learned that Farimir was stronger.  

&amp;#x200B;

His ability to comprehend and follow the story is perfectly suited for this level of reading.  He remembers names of mountains and people better than I am.  Even his 9 year old brother is doing fine.

I understand what he is and why he is powerful but my questions is more specific: when he says things like ‚Äúyou cannot pass‚Äù or ‚Äúyou have no power here‚Äù or ‚ÄúSaruman, your staff is broken‚Äù is that just him talking to his opponent? Or is that sort of like a spell being cast? Like is the statement a sort of spell casting where is is imposing his will on the world? He says the staff is broken and thus it is? I know the lore describing the power of Eru is often described as a song, so it has long been a fascination of mine that perhaps the magic is spoken into existence by a Valar like Gandalf because he is part of the choir.

My plan is the hobbit, the trilogy, Beren &amp; Luthien, the children of hurin, the fall of gondolin, and the silmarillion.

2712,lotr,"""and the Eldar said that the light of the Two Trees, Laurelin and Telperion, had been snared in her tresses. Many thought that this saying first gave to F√´anor the thought of imprisoning and blending the light of the Trees that later took shape in his hands as the Silmarils. For F√´anor beheld the hair of Galadriel with wonder and delight. He begged three times for a tress, but Galadriel would not give him even one hair. These two kinsfolk, the greatest of the Eldar of Valinor, were unfriends for ever."" 

The Silmarils are accounted as the most valuable; the fate of the universe is in them. This creation of Feanor made him to be accounted as the greatest Elf in Aman.

The Dark Lord Melkor the Morgoth stole the 3 Silmarils. And Feanor revolted against the Valar/gods to retrieve his greatest work.

""Long he spoke, and ever he urged the Noldor to follow him and by their own prowess to win freedom and great realms in the lands of the East, before it was too late; for he echoed the lies of Melkor, that the Valar had cozened them and would hold them captive so that Men might rule in Middle-earth. Many of the Eldar heard then for the first time of the Aftercomers. 'Fair shall the end be,' he cried, though long and hard shall be the road! Say farewell to bondage! But say farewell also to ease! Say farewell to the weak! Say farewell to your treasures! More still shall we make. Journey light: but bring with you your swords! For we will go further than Orom√´, endure longer than Tulkas: we will never turn back from pursuit. After Morgoth to the ends of the Earth! War shall he have and hatred undying. But when we have conquered and have regained the Silmarils, then we and we alone shall be lords of the unsullied Light, and masters of the bliss and beauty of Arda. No other race shall oust us!'
Then F√´anor swore a terrible oath. His seven sons leapt straightway to his side and took the selfsame vow together, and red as blood shone their drawn swords in the glare of the torches. They swore an oath which none shall break, and none should take, by the name even of Il√∫vatar, calling the Everlasting Dark upon them if they kept it not; and Manw√´ they named in witness, and Varda, and the hallowed mountain of Taniquetil, vowing to pursue with vengeance and hatred to the ends of the World Vala, Demon, Elf or Man as yet unborn, or any creature, great or small, good or evil, that time should bring forth unto the end of days, whoso should hold or take or keep a Silmaril from their possession.""

He immediately assaulted the fortress of Morgoth, when he arrived to Middle-earth. But got killed xD his seven sons waged wars and kinslayings for 500 years for these 3 shiny rocks.

In the end all of the seven sons died (except maybe MAYBE one of them). One of the silmarils found its place into the deeps of the earth, one in the bottom of the ocean, and only one survived; The Silmaril of Earendil that became like Venus. 

Earendil is the father of Elrond and Elros. His wife Elwing brought him the Silmaril. Elwing's grandparents had achieved an impossible Quest to steal a Silmaril from the Iron Crown of Morgoth.

Some thousands of years later Galadriel captured the Light of Earendil's Silmaril into a Phial. This is (probably) Galadriel's crowning achievement in craftsmanship/art.

""The love of the Elves for their land and their works is deeper than the deeps of the Sea, and their regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be assuaged. Yet they will cast all away rather than submit to Sauron: for they know him now."" - Galadriel 

And indeed it is. They would rather die than give up on their creations, or at least almost all of the Elves were like this, such as Feanor and Turgon. Galadriel is described as very very prideful. She is kinda the female version of Feanor. But now after thousands of years, her wisdom was full grown. She gifted her Phial to Frodo. She gave up on her greatest creations to save the world from evil.

The Phial of Galadriel saved the Quest several times : 

Frodo overcame the Command of the Witch-King to put on the Ring, by touching the Phial. 

Sam broke the sorcery of the Watchers, by using the Phial. 

The Phial eased Frodo's pain.

Sam defeated Shelob, by using the Phial.",The Phial of Galadriel explained

I already watched LOTR Extended Trilogy as recommended by this subreddit a few days ago and now wanting to watch The Hobbit. Should I watch the theatrical? the extended? or a fan-edit as I heard some of those are better that the official releases. If fan-edits, where can I watch them?

2720,lotr,,Who Were The MOST POWERFUL MEN To Ever Exist In Middle Earth? | Middle Earth Lore
2721,lotr,"So to begin with, I read the series in middle school for the first time. I enjoyed the series, but I didn‚Äôt really have the emotional intelligence to appreciate the depth of all the characters.  I read the series again at 23, and have listened to them on audio book 3 times since (I‚Äôm 30 now).  Not to mention that I‚Äôve seen all of the movies countless times. All this to say, I‚Äôm FAIRLY familiar with the series of events in the trilogy.

The plot, the characters, the humor, the companionship, the music score, and the sheer genius behind the writing style, what‚Äôs not to love? Let‚Äôs dig in.

I love the LOTR series because all of the main characters (the fellowship) have depth and there is a character for any reader of any personality type to connect with on a deep level.

I love the bond that Sam and Frodo forge because I believe that every person on this earth (and middle earth for that matter) craves that kind of relationship. The kind of relationship that you would use the last bit of energy you have to literally pick up your friend and carry him or her across the finish line that is success (be it financial, wisdom, or any area of life). A friend that you know beyond a shadow of a doubt would do the same for you when you are utterly spent.

I love the idea of all the peoples of the middle earth coming together for a single cause, putting aside differences to conquer ‚Äúevil.‚Äù The fact that anyone with any honor is willing to lay down their lives, fight the forces of Mordor against all odds of success.

Lastly, l love the depth of raw emotion invoked when reading the series OR watching the movies. IMO, the three most emotional parts of the series are when Gandalf joins the Balrog after the fight at the bridge of khazad d√ªm, the whole conversation/dialogue between Sam and Frodo about heroes not turning back despite the many chances, and when Frodo joins the elves in their journey to the gray havens. Not to say there aren‚Äôt other emotional parts of the story, these just happen to affect me the most.

*Honorable mentions: 
the fact the the movies *mostly* stick to the plot in the books is awesome.

The score in the movies is perfect. Epic. Wonderful. The bass trombone used to invoke fear in Isengard, the ‚Äúcrying‚Äù violin at the introduction of edoras (this violin solo gives me the feeling that it‚Äôs crying over a once great and mighty edoras has now withered into a sad, ALMOST hopeless city. Couple that with Gimli‚Äôs comment ‚Äúyou‚Äôd find more cheer in a graveyard,‚Äù and that solidified the mood of the city), the clarinet in ‚Äúconcerning hobbits,‚Äù providing cheer and lightheartedness, I could go on.....all of these parts of the score do a perfect job of supporting the emotion that Tolkien initially intended when writing the trilogy.

I pose the question again, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs not to love?‚Äù",Why I love LOTR

2723,lotr,"Not only do they look exceptional in 4K, but the updated color grading is great. I tip my hat to Peter and his team. Not only do the films look better than ever, but these new versions really help showcase the amazing job done by everyone who worked on the films. All of the details that the production team worked so hard on are enhanced for all to enjoy. 

Beyond the increase to 4K resolution (which looks incredible), the only other change I noticed was the new digital color grading. They definitely changed the color grading in several places; and in my humble opinion almost always made it better. I admit a few effects shots were a bit more noticeable at 4K, but for me the positives far outweighed the negatives. I highly recommend the new versions.","I just finished binging the 4K remasters today, and OMG, they are AMAZING!"

But instead of rewatching lotr 1 again, I just started on lotr 2 continued with lotr 3 and then The Hobbit trilogy, But I wanted more. So I desided to watch lotr 1 again. Many things I've already forgotten. 

But THEN I wanted to watch more. So I watched two towers even tough I recently watched it 2 weeks back. It was not so special anymore since I had just watched it. 

But now comes the big problem: Should I rewatch lotr 3 again or should I just end the marathon where I am now? Because I don't want to ruin lotr 3 because it was such an amazing movie. But I feel kind of uncomplete when I have seen the Hobbit trilogy and then lotr 1 and 2, but then stops before the third one. Even tough I watched lotr 3 2 weeks back.

What is your opinion?

&amp;#x200B;

Here is just some extra backstory. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO READ THIS TO ANSWER MY QUESTION! You can just ignore this part if you want.

In 2012 when The Hobbit came out, I watched lotr for the first time. I was still a little kid, so it wasnt so much I understood. BUT, I fell asleep during most of The Return of the King. I basically lost the whole movie. Around 2015 or 2016, I was a teen and understood a lot more. I still had a hard time recognising names and faces. So most of the movies didn't make so much sense to me. But I watched lotr 1 and 2, but I forgot to watch lotr 3! In 2019 I watched The Fellowship of the Ring. Everything made sense now! November 2020 I desided to just watch Two Towers and Return of the King. I could FINALLY watch Return of the King! First time I saw it was in November 2020. about 8 years after I first started watching The Lord of the Rings. It was such an incredible movie. But now I don't want to ruin it by watching it twice within a month. Like I did with Two Towers. And now that everything makes sense to me, I will remember a lot more.

I just want to clarify up front that if you did buy them and you love them, I am happy for you and I'm not trying to take anything away from your experience, but. . .

I must admit I'm a little saddened by the results I'm seeing in screenshots from official reviews and the new trailers that were released. The color adjustments seem to have taken so much of the style out of Andrew Lesnie and colorist Peter Doyle's original work. It's sort of heartbreaking when you consider that the LOTR trilogy was Andrew Lesnie's masterpiece and he's not alive to supervise the remaster, and from what I can tell Peter Doyle had no involvement either, and this might become the definitive version for new generations of audiences.

I'm no fan of digital sharpening at the best of times as I don't think sharpness adds anything to the emotional content of a film, but the sharpening here seems to have really killed the soft, filmic effect that gave the films their signature look, and to add insult to injury, the film grain is all but gone. See this comparison for an example: [https://i.imgur.com/6DRntOn.png](https://i.imgur.com/6DRntOn.png) The top frame which is the original, is so much more emotive to me. In comparison, the bottom frame almost looks computer generated. It's so silky smooth and without detail in the skin.

The shots and scenes I'm seeing online feel so different from the original version I fell in love with, and the update was completed without the participation of arguably the most important players in crafting that look. I just haven't seen any conversation about this online. Whatever your opinion is, this much is true: Peter Jackson and the team of colorists who re-timed the film have significantly altered the visual style and tone of the entire trilogy.

&amp;#x200B;

To boot his voice just wasn't brooding/dark enough to fit the character. Watch the clip below, he just doesn't have that leadership quality you get in some people's voices, and expect from a character like Aragorn.

So I found a reference to Tolkien explicitly declaring that the pipeweed everyone smokes is specifically a variety of nicotine, as sort of a ‚Äútake that‚Äù to all the stoner hippies that were reading things into his work that he didn‚Äôt appreciate.

I‚Äôve also read that the whole aim of Middle-Earth was that Tolkien was attempting to write something like ‚Äúa mythology for England‚Äù. They had a mythology before Roman conquest, but presumably he meant a mythology for men of his station, the sons of colonisers. But that‚Äôs a discussion for another time.

So my question is: if LOTR takes place in some psuedomythical beowulfesque age in and around Western Europe - and pipeweed‚Äôs specifically tobacco - and tobacco is a plant that grew exclusively in the Americas - how does that make any sense?

I know there‚Äôs a big Elven continent to the west  but as I understand it, the voyage is a one way journey. If we were to call Tolkien out on his own hubris and argue that pipeweed is some cannabis derivative, smoked in the middle-east and presumably by their analogues, the  Easterlings for centuries - that still doesn‚Äôt make a ton of sense. Did the Easterlings carve a swath through all of the continent, planting seeds as they went, but built no monuments or forts or anything, and then disappear without a trace?

It might sound nit picky but I‚Äôm actually genuinely curious about whether or not Tolkien managed to square this circle - whether or not it was addressed at all would be welcome information.

Thanks!",On pipeweed.

2923,lotr,,Amazing Hobbit inspired quilt by Sue McCarty
2924,lotr,"Back in 2001 they started an official LOTR fan club. The main perk was a bi-monthly magazine (it had some great articles, interviews with cast and crew, behind the scenes, etc.), but there were a few other extras like limited edition lithographs, merch discounts, and fan mail forwarding service. 

If you were a charter member, the big bonus was [having your name in the credits](https://i.imgur.com/NpAqjN8.jpg) of the DVDs (later on they changed it so it was only in the extended editions, but that didn't bother me). If you signed up for 1 year charter membership, you only got your name in FOTR credits. 2 years you also got TTT, and 3 years ROTK as well.

Seeing my name in the credits when I got that first FOTR EE was such a neat thing. I remember any time I discussed LOTR with anyone I couldn't help but sneak in ""my name is in the credits btw."" 

I didn't expect anything more than those DVDs, but then about 10 years later the blu-rays came out and to my surprise my name was there too. Now today I have the 4K blu-ray release and what do you know, there's my name again! These 4K releases are probably going to be the end game for these films as there's simply no more (meaningful) detail to be extracted from the original source beyond this. Imagine going back 20 years and having them tell you that your name would also be in the 4k blu-ray versions of the films that wouldn't release for another 20 years. I think my first question would've been ""what's a blu-ray?""

I just took a quick look and you can see that most people just opted for the 1 year membership. The FOTR fan club credits run for about 20 minutes. TTT is about 12 minutes, and ROTK is about 10 minutes of names. I always sit through the whole thing as the entire credits are scored and I simply can't watch without seeing my name scroll by.

The 3 year membership was $100 and that may be the best $100 I've spent considering what these movies mean to me. 

For a little nostalgia, you can browse the fan club site as it was back in late 2001 thanks to the internet archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20011202213127/http://lotrfanclub.com/",I got more than I bargained for when I signed up for the LOTR fan club back in 2001

reason 1:theodens charge-cavalry should never be used like that, cavalry have only been known to charge at loose formations or weak flanks.
reason 2:aragorn brings 2,000-6,000 men. too small to make a diffrence, especially on foot.
reason 3:assuming they could somehow win, they would have to kill those endless numbers of orcs inside minas tirith.
reason 4:minas tirith isn't very well designed. the walls lack towers, machicolations, a gatehouse, and the murlons break from a single catapult shot. and castles have been known to have several gates, this is known as a portcullis. its not very easy to defend without these defenses.
reason 5:the enemy is too large, my bare minimum is 30,000 orcs. 5,000 easterlings. 3,000 haradrim. and 1,200 corsairs.
against 5k gondorians, 6k rohirrim, and 5k from aragorn. plus from what i remember, uruks joined the mordor force too.
reason 6:nazgul, they are basically immortal, sure merry has the sword but with gandalfs broken staff, the nazgul could have just killed everyone one by one, maybe not aragorn but they could kill thousands.
reason 7:weaker than humans or not, a pike force will destroy any short range units or cavalry. which mordor had plenty of.

2936,lotr,"As a Christian who is well versed on the bible and a fan of Tolkien lore, I'm here to further bridge the gap between Tolkien's religious background and his literature.   


Eru Illuvatar (Allfather) is pretty much God in the bible (God the father) - Described as the light of the world. The creation of Arda through the singing of the Valar is very similar to the creation story of the Earth. The Book of Job speaks about how all the morning stars sang together and the sons of God (angels) shouted for joy when God created the Earth.   


Morgoth is pretty much a representation of Satan being that he is the fallen one (one of the valar - in the bible one of the morning stars), and Tolkien has confirmed this much that Morgoth is based off Satan. Morgoth is imprisoned in the timeless void for a time, but according to the myth he will find a way break to free in the last  days. Morgoth will set forth to go to the battle of battles where he will be slain.  


This is exactly what the Bible says about Satan in revelation who will be imprisoned for one thousand years in the bottomless pit after the second coming of Christ, and after the 1000 years are up he will break free from the bottomless pit and be let loosed for a short while. Satan will set forth to deceive many nations from the four corners of the Earth into the final battle in history where he will be defeated by God and cast into the lake of fire for destruction.   


Further more, the valar, and elves are pretty much Tolkiens way of describing the different hierarchy of celestial/angelic beings. Elves seem to be the angels, while the Valar represent the morning stars/or seraphim/cherubim that surround the throne of God in the bible.   


Furthermore, Valinor the land of Eru Illuvatar has two trees in it, just like the Garden of Eden.   


He used Christian symbolism more than once. You could say that Sauron is another archetype of Satan, but not really. Sauron is more akin to a lesser fallen angel (demon) in service to Satan (as the bible speaks of princes and principalities - high ranking angels that followed Satan in rebellion of God), as Sauron would be to Morgoth. The Bible speaks about how Satan masquerades as an angel of light, and many times in LOTR we hear of how Sauron was able to deceive the nations of middle earth with his beauty. Melkor was also described as the most beautiful and powerful of the Auinur, Satan likewise has that description in the bible being perfect, anointed by God with many jewels, and a Guardian Cherub around Gods throne. Furthermore, Satan used to be called Lucifer or ""Lightbearer"" which was a reflection of his former office of ""morning star"". But Satan lost that when he rebelled, hence forth he was known as the Satan or the ""Adversary"". Melkor also is renamed to Morgoth, just like Lucifer became Satan.   


The whole concept of a return of a king is based on the actual return of Jesus Christ, who in the bible is the king who the world is waiting to return. Jesus in the bible returns in the second coming to destroy the man of sin (antichrist who is spiritually empowered by Satan) with his armies in the battle of Armageddon (to reclaim Jerusalem and become king over the whole Earth). Who does this sound like to you, yep you guessed it! Aragorn! Aragorn, the return of the king, saves Gondor, defeats the armies of evil, brings peace to middle earth.  Not only that but Jesus in the Bible is a descendant of David, a special bloodline, and Aragorn comes from a special bloodline going back to the glory days of the dunedain royalty.   


The fact that the antichrists or the beasts armies are empowered by Satan - mirrored with Sauromon and Sauron and their armies acting on evil is based off the seed of darkness left behind by Morgoth - further shows that Tolkien's representation of darkness and evil in LOTR is exactly based off the darkness and evil of Satan and his rebels.   


Tolkien said before that his world of Arda was supposed to mix in with our current world, and him being a Christian is his way of adding his beliefs into the LOTR. Essentially, Morgoth IS Satan, Eru Illuvatar is God/Jesus and the creator of Arda, elves are angels, etc - He just doesn't explicitly say it cause he wanted to make it a fantasy world also with different names. I could go on forever drawing out all the symbolism because it's literally based off the bible, but I'll pay writing a book at that point so this will do for now.

2993,lotr,"My plan is to watch the trilogy before the week is out. I started with The Fellowship of the Ring last night and I can honestly say...it literally blew me away. Three distinct things I noticed with the 4K version:

1) The details are just so much more profound. When you look at the initial map of Middle Earth in the prologue there‚Äôs so many more intricacies and details that really didn‚Äôt pop out before. Middle Earth itself (the leaves, fields, rocks, trees) looks so much more crisp. Up close shots to characters, especially Gandalf, look amazing as you can see details in his beard and clothing. Won‚Äôt go on much as this was expected, but they really did an incredible job.

2) This is my favorite part of the 4K release and took me by surprise. The color palette they used is absolutely beautiful. They really looked at brightening and enhancing certain hues (the green in nature, the moonlight in Moria, fire with the Balrog). Their re-working of the colors and Jackson‚Äôs attempts to give the films (including The Hobbit films) all ‚Äúone look‚Äù really stands out. You can tell with The Shire and Rivendell he was really going for the color palette from An Unexpected Journey. I thought I‚Äôd be opposed to seeing this in Fellowship of the Ring, but because this film was shot in 35mm, I feel it still keeps its own look and style, just with brighter and more eye-popping colors. The HDR definitely helps and it‚Äôs beautiful to look at. I literally said ‚ÄúWow‚Äù to myself a few times when looking at specific scenes. The final battle with the Uruk-hai was awesome (really green trees, deep blacks on the Uruk-hai, the sun peeking through the trees). I felt every character and every scene had their own specific look instead of just seeing a standard tint throughout the film. The contrast was definitely top notch. 

3) Only MILD drawback, which was expected, is that with the increased detail, you do see some of the mild flaws in some of the CGI. But thankfully, Jackson used so many practical effects that it didn‚Äôt concern me. It was maybe 2-3 things I noticed that stood out more than before. Like I said, very mild drawback. But wanted to include the good and ‚Äúbad‚Äù here.

Overall though, I think the transfer was perfect. Outside of re-working CGI, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs going to be a better version of this film out there. I usually don‚Äôt write reviews on here about 4K releases, but this one really blew me away. Great work to Jackson, his team, and WB!",Fellowship of the Ring 4K - Thoughts on Picture Quality

3001,lotr,"**Basic facts:**

Tolkien visited Switzerland once for a few weeks in the summer (July/August) of 1911 at age of 19. He and his brother were taken by the slightly eccentric sounding Brookes-Smith family. They went as a very mixed party of 12 (with a local guide too) and did an impressive amount of walking whilst carrying heavy loads and often sleeping rough.

 Most of the information about this comes from a letter [(letter 306)](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Letter_306) that he wrote to his son 57 years later in 1968 at the age of 76. Some parts are clearly remembered and directly linked to places in the books, others are skipped over or rather more vague. So it is a little hard to figure it out exactly what he did (still not bad for a brief letter written so long after just being somewhere once). Another letter [(letter 232)](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Letter_232) directly states that some of the events ended up in the Hobbit. Both are at the end of this post. 

 

Just about all of the attention goes to Lauterbrunnen: being the touristy photogenic spot everyone likes to shout about Lauterbrunnen having the connection to him, but they did a bigger tour that certainly inspired other parts of his work.

Simply put it seems to go:

Birmingham - Munich ‚Äì Innsbruck - Interlaken ‚Äì Lauterbrunnen ‚Äì M√ºrren ‚Äì Kleine Scheidegg ‚Äì Grosse Scheidegg ‚Äì Meiringen ‚Äì Grimselpass ‚Äì Brig - Somewhere at the base of the Aletsch glacier (Belalp maybe?) ‚Äì Zermatt - ?Arolla?.

[Google map of the rough route and places he mentions in Switzerland](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uhe23GA8U--BkxjCjqhLFBRBISafLBJI&amp;usp=sharing).

 They certainly got about, and especially so if (as it sounds) they did it all by foot. By my estimate this is at least 232km with 8000m of height gain. And that is ignoring uncertain side excursions which would add a fair bit more height change on. Hardcore seemed to be the order of the day going by the diary of Miss Jemima Morrell who was one of the first package tourists to Switzerland. 

**The letters:**

Letter 306

&gt;*I am.... delighted that you have made the acquaintance of Switzerland, and of the very part that I once knew best and which had the deepest effect on me. The hobbit's (Bilbo's) journey from Rivendell to the other side of the Misty Mountains, including the glissade down the slithering stones into the pine woods, is based on my adventures in 1911: the annus mirabilis of sunshine in which there was virtually no rain between April and the end of October, except on the eve and morning of George V's coronation. (Adfuit Omen!)*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Our wanderings mainly on foot in a party of 12 are not now clear in sequence, but leave many vivid pictures as clear as yesterday (that is as clear as an old man's remoter memories become).*  
&gt;  
&gt;*We went on foot carrying great packs practically all the way from Interlaken, mainly by mountain paths, to Lauterbrunnen and so to M√ºrren and eventually to the head of the Lauterbrunnenthal in a wilderness of morains. We slept rough ‚Äì the men-folk ‚Äì often in hayloft or cowbyre, since we were walking by map and avoided roads and never booked, and after a meagre breakfast fed ourselves in the open: cooking utensils and quantities of 'spridvin' (as the one uneducated French-speaking member of the party both called and wrote it, for 'methylated spirit').*  
&gt;  
&gt;*We must then have gone eastward over the two Scheidegge to Grindelwald, with Eiger and M√∂nch on our right, and eventually reached Meiringen. I left the view of Jungfrau with deep regret: eternal snow, etched as it seemed against eternal sunshine, and the Silberhorn sharp against dark blue: the Silvertine (Celebdil) of my dreams.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*We later crossed the Grimsell Pass down on to the dusty highway, beside the Rhone, on which horse 'diligences' still plied: but not for us. We reached Brig on foot, a mere memory of noise : then a network of trams that screeched on their rails for it seemed at least 20 hrs of the day.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*After a night of that we climbed up some thousands of feet to a village at the foot of the Aletsch glacier, and there spent some nights in a ch√¢let inn under a roof and in beds (or rather under them: the bett being a shapeless bag under which you snuggled). I can remember several incidents there! One was going to confession in Latin; others less exemplary were the invention of a method of dealing with your friends the harvestmen spiders, by dropping hot wax from a candle onto their fat bodies (this was not approved of by the servants); also the practice of the beaver-game which had always fascinated me. A wonderful place for the game, plenty of water at that altitude coming down in rills, abundant damming material in loose stones, heather, grass and mud. We soon had a beautiful little 'pond' (containing I guess at least 200 gallons). Then the pangs of hunger smote us, and one of the hobbits of the party (he is still alive) shouted 'lunch' and wrecked the dam with his alpenstock. The water soared down the hill-side, and we then observed that we had dammed a rill that ran down to feed the tanks and butts behind the inn. At that moment an old dame trotted out with a bucket to fetch some water, and was greeted by a mass of foaming water. She dropped the bucket and fled calling on the saints. We lay more doggo than 'men of the moss-hags' for some time, and eventually wound our way round to present ourselves grubby (but we were usually so on that trip) and sweetly innocent at 'lunch'.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*One day we went on a long march with guides up the Aletsch glacier ‚Äì when I came near to perishing. We had guides, but either the effects of the hot summer were beyond their experience, or they did not much care, or we were late in starting. Any way at noon we were strung out in file along a narrow track with a snow-slope on the right going up to the horizon, and on the left a plunge down into a ravine. The summer of that year had melted away much snow, and stones and boulders were exposed that (I suppose) were normally covered. The heat of the day continued the melting and we were alarmed to see many of them starting to roll down the slope at gathering speed: anything from the size of oranges to large footballs, and a few much larger. They were whizzing across our path and plunging into the ravine. 'Hard pounding,' ladies and gentlemen. They started slowly, and then usually held a straight line of descent, but the path was rough and one had also to keep an eye on one's feet. I remember the member of the party just in front of me (an elderly schoolmistress) gave a sudden squeak and jumped forward as a large lump of rock shot between us. About a foot at most before my unmanly knees.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*After this we went on into Valais, and my memories are less clear; though I remember our arrival, bedraggled, one evening in Zermatt and the lorgnette stares of the French bourgeoises dames. We climbed with guides up to \[a\] high hut of the Alpine Club, roped (or I should have fallen into a snow-crevasse), and I remember the dazzling whiteness of the tumbled snow-desert between us and the black horn of the Matterhom some miles away.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*I do not suppose all this is very interesting now. But it was a remarkable experience for me at 19, after a poor boy's childhood. I went up to Oxford that autumn.*

Letter 232

&gt;*I always like shrewd sound-hearted maiden aunts. Blessed are those who have them or meet them. Though they are commoner, in my experience, than Saki aunts. The professional aunt is a fairly recent development, perhaps; but I was fortunate in having an early example: one of the first women to take a science degree. She is now ninety, but only a few years ago went botanizing in Switzerland.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*It was in her company (with a mixed party of about the same size as the company in The Hobbit) that I journeyed on foot with a heavy pack through much of Switzerland, and over many high passes. It was approaching the Aletsch that we were nearly destroyed by boulders loosened in the sun rolling down a snow-slope. An enormous rock in fact passed between me and the next in front. That and the 'thunder-battle' ‚Äì a bad night in which we lost our way and slept in a cattle-shed ‚Äì appear in The Hobbit. It is long ago now. ....*

3084,lotr,,"I‚Äôm in love, these sets are so nice"
3085,lotr,"Throughout the three Ages of Middle-earth, the Free Peoples have always been faced with a 'great enemy.' In the First Age there was Morgoth. In the Second Age there was Sauron. But although Sauron's malice lingered all the way up to the destruction of the One Ring, I would argue that he was *not* the great enemy the Third Age. I mean obviously Sauron was the Dark Lord of Mordor, and the Servants of Shadow were *his* servants, but by the Third Age, Sauron's days as an active aggressor were behind him. The great enemy of the Third Age (at least from the perspective of the D√∫nedain and the Elves) was a mysterious new threat that arose in the frozen land of iron. He was the Witch-king of Angmar. The king breaker.

So I feel that when compared to Morgoth and Sauron, it's very easy to diminish the Witch-king's influence over Middle-earth. After all he's not a Vala. He's not a Maia. He's simply a Man. Or at least he used to be. Unlike both Morgoth and Sauron, the Witch-king has no ambition to rule or to dominate for his own sake. He is simply a slave to his master. He is a wraith bound to a ring. And yet, the Witch-king is singlehandedly responsible for not only breaking the line of kings of Gondor, but he effectively wiped the Lost Kingdom of Arnor from the map. Throughout the Third Age, I'd argue there was no greater threat the Free Peoples. There was no deadlier enemy.

So in order to understand what the Witch-king did, and why he's significant, we need to take a look at the two kingdoms of the D√∫nedain. So I'm sure everyone here will know about Gondor - the Land of Stone - that was founded by Isildur and his brother, after the downfall of N√∫menor. However in the beginning Gondor was simply the other kingdom of the D√∫nedain. The lesser kingdom. Far to the north lay the kingdom of Isildur's father. The great Kingdom of Arnor, which was known colloquially as the King's Land. It was ruled by Elendil, and back in the day, Arnor was the greatest kingdom of Men ever to exist in Middle-earth. In fact the King of Arnor was also the High King of all the D√∫nedain, and his rule extended over both Arnor *and* Gondor.

But, as we all know, Elendil didn't last too long in Middle-earth. After the War of the Last Alliance, both Elendil and Isildur's brother had been slain, and two years later, Isildur joined them in death. So the two kingdoms went their separate ways. Arnor was ruled by the sons of Isildur, and Gondor was ruled by the sons of his late brother. And it would take three thousand and nine years for the two kingdoms to be reunited again under one king. That king is of course Aragorn. But over the next few thousand years, there was *another* king who changed the course of both kingdoms. And this king is of course the Witch-king of Angmar.

So referring to the Witch-king as a king is actually a little bit misleading. We know next to nothing about the character's origins, except that he was the chief of the Nazg√ªl. But in the Silmarillion Tolkien does tell us that three of the Nazg√ªl were once *""great lords of N√∫men√≥rean race.""* Now we can't say for certain that the Witch-king was one of these three, but it seems very likely if he's the mightiest of the Nazg√ªl. And this of course would mean that he was not actually a king at all (or at least not by birthright). All the N√∫men√≥rean kings are accounted for, and none were given rings of power. And so during the rise of the Ringwraiths in the Second Age, their leader was simply known as the Lord of the Nazg√ªl. And when Sauron fell in the War of the Last Alliance, the Nazg√ªl disappeared with him. At least for a while.

Now when we talk about the Witch-king, we all take it for granted that he is the Lord of the Nazg√ªl, and the captain of Sauron's mightiest servants. But when he first arose in Angmar, this was not common knowledge. The Nazg√ªl had been gone for over a thousand years at that point, and so the Men of Arnor knew only that he was a mysterious evil who'd emerged from the frozen lands of Angmar. So they called him the Witch-king of Angmar. And the name pretty much stuck.

Now if there's one thing that can be said about the Witch-king, it's that he's patient. Despite the fact that he arrived in Angmar in the year 1300 of the Third Age, it was 109 years before he actually declared war against Arnor. And in that century, he established his capital at Carn D√ªm, and summoned an army of orcs and evil men into his service. And he waited.

You see, as is so often the case, the Men of Arnor turned out to be the cause of their own undoing. Because 982 years after its founding, Arnor was broken and divided by internal conflict among the tenth king's three sons. The once proud and mighty nation of Elendil was split into three rival lordships. First of these lordships was Arthedain, which was ruled by the old king's eldest son. The second lordship was called Cardolan, and the third was called Rhudaur. For hundreds of years, these three territories fought amongst each other. Each of them staked a claim to the Palantir of Amon S√ªl, which lay at in the middle of old Arnor, and for many generations the North Kingdom of the D√∫nedain was weakened by division and infighting. For the heirs of Isildur this was a disaster, but for the Witch-king, it was exactly what he'd been waiting for. In the year 1409, he perceived that the time had come to destroy Arnor entirely.

So the Witch-king's first move was to infiltrate the hearts and minds of his enemies, and to turn the enemies of his enemies into allies. In Arthedain, the blood of the D√∫nedain still ran thick, and in Cardolan a memory persisted of the old days when Arnor was united. But in Rhudaur, there was no such nostalgia. The descendants of Isildur had long since died out in Rhudaur, and the territory was now ruled not by D√∫nedain, but by wild Hill-men. And with a secret alliance from Angmar, these Hill-men took power.

Now I think it's important to note that the Witch-king didn't invade Rhudaur through conquest. His armies didn't march into Rhudaur and take it. Instead, the Hill-men were enticed into doing the Witch-king's work on his behalf, and he simply annexed the territory once it's local population had risen up against the D√∫nedain and slaughtered those who remained. Nevertheless, with Rhudaur under the Witch-king's dominion, Arnor's end had now officially begun.

However all was not yet lost. The Lord of Arthedain was a man called Argeleb, and Argeleb was one of the few descendants of Isildur left in Arnor. So by the right of his bloodline, Argeleb sought to reunite the three territories and return Arnor to its glory days. Cardolan agreed, and although they kept their own princes, throughout Arthedain and Cardolan Argeleb was recognised as the true king of all Arnor. But in Rhudaur, the Witch-king ruled. And so eventually, the combined forced of Angmar and Rhudaur declared outright war on what remained of Arnor.

So the first named casualty of the Angmar War was King Argeleb himself. He successfully fortified the Weather Hills, and he defended the great watchtower that would one day become known as Weathertop, but after only seven years of rule, Argeleb was killed. And so Argeleb was succeeded by his son Arveleg. And this is where things get a little confusing, because pretty much every ruler of Arnor after Argeleb, takes the prefix *Ar*\- at the beginning of their name; all the way down to even Arathorn and Aragron. *Ar* simply means king in the Ad√ªnaic language of the N√∫men√≥reans, and so it denotes a person's right to rule, but it does mean that many of Arnor's kings all have very similar sounding names. That's just the way Tolkien did things!

Anyway Arveleg son of Argeleb carried on his father's legacy of resisting the Witch-king, and just as the Witch-king had made an alliance with orcs and Hill-men, Arveleg made alliances of his own with the Princes of Cardolan, and the elves of the Grey Havens. Together they were able to slow the advance of the Witch-king, but much like winter itself, the Witch-king could not be prevented entirely.

In the year 1409, a battle was fought atop the watchtower of Amon S√ªl. The defenders were comprised of Arveleg's men, his allies from Cardolan, and (possibly though not definitely) some Elves from the Grey Havens. The attackers were all servants of the Witch-king. And this battle was a disaster for the men of Arnor. Both King Arveleg and the last prince of Cardolan were slain, Amon S√ªl was burned and razed, and the territory of Cardolan fell to Angmar.

And there's something quite interesting here that comes full circle in *The* *Lord of the Rings.* Because we're told by Tolkien that the last Prince of Cardolan was interred in a Barrow-down, and its very possible that this Barrow-down was the same one that Frodo and the Hobbits would become trapped in over one and a half thousand years later. And of course that's not the only reference to this battle that we see in Lord of the Rings. Because Arveleg's death upon Weathertop, is eerily similar to Frodo's near death experience in that same place. And both events were precipitated by the Witch-king.

However, Arveleg's death was not quite the end for Arnor. In fact the defeat at Amon S√ªl, marked a new beginning for the D√∫nedain of the North Kingdom. Because after King Arveleg came his 18 year old son, Araphor. And Araphor had the backing of C√≠rdan the Shipwright, Lord of the Grey Havens (and my personal favourite elf), as well as support from Elrond, who provided Elven warriors from both Rivendell and Lothl√≥rien. And in Arnor's new capital city of Fornost, the combined armies of Araphor, C√≠rdan, and Elrond repelled the Witch-king, and utterly defeated his forces. And for almost five hundred years, there was peace in the North. But it was not to last.

You see the Witch-king returned to his capital of Carn D√ªm, and there he began rebuilding his army. And although five different kings of Arthedain came and went, and lived out their reigns in relative peace, the Witch-king was not idle. Over these centuries he sent evil spirits to inhabit the burial mounds of Cardolan, which were known for a time as Tyrn Gorthad, although they're better known now as the Barrow-downs. And poor old Cardolan was also ravaged by a Great Plague that spread from the lands east of Mordor. It's inhabitants were either struck down by sickness or assailed by the Barrow-wights, and eventually, just like Rhudaur before it, Cardolan fell to the power of the Witch-king.

Now the Witch-king's hour finally came in the year 1974. During the reign of King Arvedui (the great great great great grandson of King Araphor) Arnor's capital of Fornost was conquered by the armies of Angmar, and the Witch-king himself took up residence in the former capital of his enemies. And sadly, this marked the point of no return for Arnor. Now to be fair, King Arvedui did survive the Fall of Fornost and he fled with two Palantiri and a small group of loyal D√∫nedain far up into the icy northern wastes, where he sought shelter with the mysterious Snow Men of Forochel. But he never returned. In fact what Arvedui's name literally means is ""the last king"", and this name was given to him by a wise old seer called Malbeth. And as it turns out, Malbeth‚Äôs foresight was pretty spot on. Arvedui did indeed drown in the ice bay with both of his Palantiri - far away from his beloved kingdom of Arnor. And with Arvedui's death, the line of kings in the north failed.

Now, as you're reading this you may very well be wondering about what Gondor's been up to this whole time. Why didn't their kings send aid to Arnor in its time of need? Well the answer is that at this time, Gondor was about as militarily screwed as Arnor was. It seems that Sauron knew what he was doing when he sent the Witch-king up north, because while Arnor was battling Angmar, Gondor was busy battling enemies of its own. Only thirty years before the fall of Fornost, Gondor had suffered a disastrous defeat at the hands of a group of Easterlings known as the Wainriders. King Ondoher of Gondor was slain, and so were both of his male heirs (fun fact - Ondoher's daughter ended up marrying Arvedui). So it seemed that both Kingdoms of the D√∫nedain were limping towards death's door.

But it was not the end.

You see the year before Arvedui died, he sent a message to Ondoher's successor, the new king of Gondor, E√§rnil II. And King E√§rnil promised to send a fleet of ships to help Arnor as soon as he was able. So E√§rnil sent his son E√§rnur (who has another confusingly similar name) to sail from Gondor to the Grey Havens in the hopes of uniting with the men of Arnor and defeating the Witch-king once and for all. And the fleet of Gondor was no small force. In fact it was pretty massive. The ships of Captain E√§rnur filled all three bays of Mithlond (the Grey Havens), Forlond, and Harlond, and amongst their number were knights of Gondor and riders of Rhovanion (the ancestors of the riders of Rohan). But that wasn't all. E√§rnur's army was bolstered by warriors of the Elven Lords C√≠rdan, Elrond, and Glorfindel, Silvan elves of L√≥rien, survivors of Arnor, and we're even told that a company of Hobbit archers came to join the Host of the West. So under the command of Captain E√§rnur, a great army set out to do battle with the Witch-king of Angmar, and they would not stop until Arnor had been utterly cleansed of his evil presence.

And for the most part, this renewed war was a roaring success. E√§rnur and his army marched through Arnor slaying orcs and evil men wherever they could be found. But the final battle would take place at Fornost; the former capital of the kings of Arthedain. And in this battle the Witch-king brought everything he had against the Host of the West.

But the Witch-king was arrogant. Instead of remaining in Fornost and using the city's fortress-like defences against E√§rnur, he marched out and met the army of E√§rnur in open battle. And Tolkien doesn't give us many details about this battle, but we know that forces of Angmar were utterly defeated. The Witch-king rallied his servants and fled back into the north towards his fortress of Carn D√ªm. But before he could get there, the Witch-king was set upon by the combined cavalry of E√§rnur and Glorfindel, and Tolkien tells us that after the battle *""not a man nor an orc of that realm*\[Angmar\] *remained west of the mountains"".* Angmar was vanquished. But the Witch-king was not.

So, when all was lost for Angmar, the Witch-king found E√§rnur on the battlefield and singled him out. He rode upon E√§rnur with a great cry, and although E√§rnur bravely held his ground, his horse was overcome with fear and it fled before the Witch-king while E√§rnur was helpless to stop it. Thus the Witch-king laughed and declared E√§rnur a coward. And he fled back to Mordor before E√§rnur could prove him wrong.

Now this is pretty much the end of Arnor's story, but it's not the end of the Witch-king's. He returned to Sauron, and within a few years he'd reconquered Minas Ithil (the old city of Isildur), which was afterwards renamed Minas Morgul; the Tower of Black Sorcery. But in the north, the survivors of Arnor were too few and too weak to rebuild their own kingdom, and so Arnor was lost, and all that remained of its former glory were the ruins of its cities and the rangers of the North. However in Gondor, Captain E√§rnur returned as a conquering hero, and when his father E√§rnil died, E√§rnur became the new King of Gondor.

But, despite his success in defeating the Witch-king, E√§rnur would not be remembered for his military exploits. His fate was far darker. You see, just like with Arvedui, E√§rnur was destined to be the final king of the D√∫nedain for over a thousand years. And just like with Arvedui, his doom came directly from the Witch-king himself.

So after E√§rnur's coronation, the Witch-king once again challenged him, and once again he reminded E√§rnur of his perceived cowardice at the Battle of Fornost. Now E√§rnur wasn't a bad king, but he was known primarily for his military prowess, and in many ways he was more like a champion than a king. So when the Witch-king renewed his challenge seven years later, this was simply too much for E√§rnur to abide, and against the advice of literally everyone, he rode off to Minas Morgul to answer the Witch-king's challenge. And E√§rnur never returned.

Now it's possible that E√§rnur knew this would be a one way trip, because he very interestingly took off his crown before departing Minas Tirith, and he left it in the Houses of the Dead. And there the crown remained for over a thousand years, until Faramir son of Denethor took it up once more, and presented it to Aragorn for his coronation.

And the reason that E√§rnur wasn't succeeded by his heir, is because no one knows exactly what happened to him. The king rode into Minas Morgul, but he never rode out. He was never seen again. And we could spend hours speculating over what actually happened to him, but the truth it that Tolkien never tells us. And at the end of the day, what more is there to say than that the Witch-king won? After the disappearance of E√§rnur, the rule of Gondor passed to the stewards, and although the kingdom endured, the royal line was wiped out. Ironically in Arnor the opposite happened. The royal line endured, but the kingdom was wiped out.

Anyway after the disappearance of E√§rnur, the Witch-king does fade a bit from the annals of history. He attacked Osgiliath more than once, but his next real contribution to the Third Age would not begin until the hunt for the Ring. And yet, despite the fact that he sat out most of the second half to the Third Age, the Witch-king's actions in Arnor forever changed the history of the D√∫nedain. More so than any other villain of the Third Age, the Witch-king left a truly dark mark on the world.

However, eventually his victims would be avenged, although it happened in a fairly roundabout way. You see way back, during the reign of King Argeleb II (the son of Araphor), the king invited two brothers to lead their people into a protected area of his realm. And these brothers happened to be of the newly arrived race of Hobbits. So King Argeleb gave to them the green country that would go on to be known as The Shire. And for many years, the Hobbits lived peacefully as grateful allies of the kings of Arnor.

Now a thousand years later and a thousand miles away, the Steward of Gondor, a man called Cirion, made a similar gift of land to his allies, who'd helped him in Gondor's war against the Easterlings. This land in Eastern Gondor was called Calenardhon, but in later years it became known as the Kingdom of Rohan. And again, for many years, the horsemen of Rohan lived as grateful allies alongside the rulers of Gondor.

So if we skip forward now to the Witch-king's eventual end, we'll see how all these strands come together. Because the Witch-king of Angmar was not killed by a Knight of Gondor, nor by a Ranger of Arnor; instead he was killed by a union of one Hobbit from The Shire, and one shield-maiden from Rohan. Regular mortals from lands that were gifts of the D√∫nedain, ended up avenging the Kings of the D√∫nedain, and they concluded the reign of the Witch-king once and for all.

So, thank you all very much for reading this, I'd love to hear your thoughts and comments on the Witch-king and his role in Middle-earth. As some of you may already know, I've been working on a series of YouTube videos about Tolkien's Legendarium. The series is called *Tolkien Untangled*, and there are plenty of video essays like this one as well as videos explaining the Silmarillion, and the differences between the Lord of the Rings books and movies. So check out *Tolkien Untangled* on YouTube if you'd like to learn more.

The other day I was seeing the Return of the King. As the charge of the Rohirrim came about, i wondered what would be racing in the heads of the numerous soldiers there. I always found this scene to be one of my personal favourites. In my mind, i could imagine an old veteran, in front of a hearth, telling his tale to a small crowd of young faces who had asked about the War of the Ring. I started to write, and this was the final result. Hope you like it. 

&amp;#x200B;

""I was there that day. 

The day we stared oblivion right in the eye. The day we knew would be our last. 

I remember the journey, the long wait in the shadow of the White Mountais. I remember faces turn grimm when, day by day, so few arrived. At night, around the fires, few words were spoken, few smiles were seen. We talked not of victory or battle but of home and family. I remember the reflection of the hearths upon countless eyes around me, all deep in thought. 

Most of us knew... most knew what awaited us. 

Yet, we rode to Minas Tirith. That day, i felt two things I had never felt. I had faced the horrors of battle before. I had seen the waste laid upon countless vilages by Saruman's hordes, I had stared many-a orc's dark eyes, I had faced hundred's of Sauron's dark spawn, I had ridden with the sun at my back at Helm's Deep...

But nothing, nothing could have prepared me for what I saw when we arrived at the Pelennor Fields. A black tide crashing upon Minas Tirith, a boiling mass that darkened the very earth, a sea of hate drowing all that lived. They were beyond count, stretching as far as the eye could see. Some part of me, a hopefull bastion, had clinged to the hope of victory. But in that moment, all doubt abandoned me. 

I would die that day, beneath the White Tower. I remember the faces of those around me turn pale when the odds were laid bare. I saw the best riders of the Mark, my brothers, my fellow Eorlingas, shrink in their saddles like green recruits. 

Now... now we all knew.

Fear gripped me. I was no stranger to fear but, for the first time in my years, it paralised me. I was paralised thinking not of my death, but that of all I held dear, even of the very world. If not for the sound of our horns, annoucing our arrival, I would have stayed frozen in my saddle. When they ripped the air I regained control of my body. Well... some control. My heart raced, my legs trembeled, my spear tipped back and forth. I thought of home, of family, of friends, none of wich I'd see again. I am not ashamed to admit it, my courage left me. 

Then i saw him, Th√©oden, my King, a few paces from me, shouting orders to his lieutenants. His golden armour shining under the, now rising, sun. As he paced back and forth, our eyes crossed for a fleeting moment  and i saw in them the same shadow that plaged the eyes of all those around me.

 He too, like all of us, knew. 

But amidst the darkness, something else flickered in his eyes. A flame of defiance, a proud flame that promised, to any and all, that it's snuffing would come with a price, that it would not go quietly into oblivion. Then, he spoke. 

He told us what we all knew, we faced destruction. Still, he beckoned us to ride. Not for victory or country, but for ruin. We would ride for this, our last day. We would ride to our end, but we would still ride. As our king spoke, I was baffled with the words he uttered. How could someone be so brave in the face of such evil? Then, something changed in me, in all of us. However short the speech was, those simple words struck my core. A stilness ran through my very soul. A calm, I had never sensed before, soothed my mind. I looked to my brothers and saw the same. The same resolute acceptance of death. But with it, something else. 

That flicker I had seen in my King's eyes turned to flame on all of our faces. We know understood what our king asked of us. If this was to be our last day, he asked that we live it as warriors. If this was to be our last day, he asked that we made the enemy rue it for eternity. No longer were we afraid. We were all dead men, and dead men do not fear death. My king called to it, we all did. With every shout, our resolve strengthened. As we called to it, we made a promise to all that could hear us. There would be no retreat. There would be no survivors. Finally, our destination was clear, our future certain. 

The enemy shifted, forming to meet us. It mattered not. They could take nothing from us, for we had nothing to lose. Darkness would find us all, but we would meet it, spear in hand. My king gave the order. Horns sounded, my mind was still. The dark tide no longer seemed overwhelming, beyond count. When defeat is certain, it matters not the numbers of the enemy. More horns filled the air. 

One last cry of defiance as we charged oblivion, and hoped it would find us worthy. 

To this day, I know not what divine grace allowed me to survived that, our most glorious charge. But this I can say: I recall the battle of Pelennor Fields everyday. And everyday I thank the gods, not because i survived... 

I thank them because 

I was there that day.""",Ride of the Rohirimm - A veteran's tale

For Ar-Pharaz√¥n wavered at the end, and almost he turned back. His heart misgave him when he looked upon the soundless shores and saw Taniquetil shining, whiter than snow, colder than death, silent, immutable, terrible as the shadow of the light of Il√∫vatar. But pride was now his master, and at last he left his ship and strode upon the shore, claiming the land for his own, if none should do battle for it. And a host of the N√∫men√≥reans encamped in might about T√∫na, whence all the Eldar had fled.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then Manw√´ upon the Mountain called upon Il√∫vatar, and for that time the Valar laid down their government of Arda. **But Il√∫vatar showed forth his power, and he changed the fashion of the world; and a great chasm opened in the sea between N√∫menor and the Deathless Lands**, and the waters flowed down into it, and the noise and smoke of the cataracts went up to heaven, and the world was shaken. And all the fleets of the N√∫men√≥reans were drawn down into the abyss, and they were drowned and swallowed up for ever. But Ar-Pharaz√¥n the King and the mortal warriors that had set foot upon the land of Aman were buried under falling hills: there it is said that they lie imprisoned in the Caves of the Forgotten, until the Last Battle and the Day of Doom.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But the land of Aman and Eress√´a of the Eldar were taken away and removed beyond the reach of Men for ever.

""Thus it was that great mariners among them would still search the empty seas, hoping to come upon the Isle of Meneltarma, and there to see a vision of things that were. But they found it not. And those that sailed far came only to the new lands, and found them like to the old lands, and subject to death. **And those that sailed furthest set but a girdle about the Earth and returned weary at last to the place of their beginning; and they said: ‚ÄòAll roads are now bent.‚Äô**  
&gt;

3247,lotr,"Ok help me out with this one. 

I remember watching the extended editions of Fellowship and the Two Towers when I was younger and loving them.

A few months ago, I found all three LOTR movies available on my TV subscription in India. Super excited, settled in for a weekend of bliss.

Some extended scenes in Fellowship and Two Towers didn‚Äôt ring many bells, but it had been a while. My main problem was with Return of the King. There were a few scenes that really took away from the plot and dragged, and just weren‚Äôt good. The worst one:

When Aragorn goes to the army of the dead to get their allegiance, the iconic moment in the original is when he says ‚ÄúWhat say you??‚Äù And then the scene cuts and we don‚Äôt see them again until the battle of Pelennor Fields and Aragorn leaps out of the ships with the army of the dead behind him. Chills, literal chills.

Except in this extended edition, after Aragorn‚Äôs line ‚ÄúWhat say you?‚Äù WE SEE HIM NEGOTIATE WITH THE DEAD KING. The army of the dead agrees to fight m, then we watch them all walk out of the cave. They come out, see the ships sailing down the river, and then have a rom-com wink wink nudge nudge moment before ambushing the ships. Anticlimactic is an understatement.

I‚Äôve been viscerally anti-extended editions ever since. I see memes on here about people loving them and I scowl. Am I missing something, or did I watch some wanky bootleg versions?",Have I Been Watching the Wrong Extended Editions?

3300,lotr,"Peter Jackson saved the Hobbit and should be encouraged to do work on more Tolkien material. 

Most people have a lot to say, in a not so much pleasant manner, about the hobbit movies. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs stretched out to 3 movies for a cash grab‚Äù. ‚Äúit‚Äôs not exactly like the books‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs using to much cgi‚Äù.  Yes, the movies had problems, but Peter Jackson saved the movies. Firstly, Peter wasn‚Äôt even the original director for the movies. He wanted to let others take a shot at the movies, but when Del Toro backed out, a year and a half into pre production, he left the entire project in shambles. He had no clue how to do the movie or meet the demands of the studio so he ran out.

There was no proper script, they had nothing planned when Peter took over. They wanted to squish the entire movie into 1 film for the hobbit and another for some made up stories for the between connection of the hobbit and lotr, a major mistake that would have been a joke of a film. Peter Jackson had been given 3 months in pre production to prepare the movie. That‚Äôs 3 months compared to his 3 years for LOTR. The studio was going broke and was halted by law suit after law suit, so they rushed Peter on every one of his choices cause they were desperate. They didn‚Äôt even have a cast for most of the characters. Martin Freeman wasn‚Äôt even Bilbo when Peter came in. They were so rushed that they had to cgi everything because the studio wouldn‚Äôt allow them to slow down production to make it as good as LOTR was.

The movie had so many complications and so many problems caused by Del Toro leaving that, the fact that we received 3 good movies in the aftermath of everything, we should be happy that we got what we got. 

I want more films by Peter to cover the rest of Tolkien‚Äôs works. He took a dumpster fire and gave us something we can at least enjoy.",A more than unpopular opinion

3414,lotr,"I'm sure this topic has been done to death here, but I recently reread LOTR and had some thoughts on Tom that I was hoping to get some thoughts on.  I may be way off but would appreciate some other opinions. 

What stuck out to me was that Tom was modelled after his child's doll.  I think Tom really represents the comforts of childhood which is similar to what a doll represents to a child.  Children's toys can provide comfort and support and in a child's mind they may have almost limited powers to protect them but these are obviously limited to the realm of a child's mind.  They can help a child feel safe from the strangeness and challenges that come from life.  But eventually the child needs to grow and face reality and go on their life journey and at some point they pass beyond where there toys or dolls can give them comfort and protection.  They are forced to resolve their own issues and grow up.


I think this describes Tom pretty well.  Tom is a pretty silly character that sings nonsense and seems to enjoy life much like a child would.  Just like the childhood toy, he has power to protect the hobbits but only within his realm. The hobbits have his protection early in their journey but are forced to look past it and forced to solve their own issues and leave that comfort.  Tom doesn't care about the concerns and temptations or the real world represented by the ring just like a child doesn't care about the stock market or political power.  They might be curious but don't grasp the significance. 

Also, Gandalf does mention that Tom's power and his realm can eventually be affected if the problems of the real world become to large.  This is just like how the security and comfort of our childhood can be taken away when things from the outside world like war interfere.  

Anyway, just some thoughts from mylast read through.  I think this is the key to why Tolkien felt Tom was important to leave in.  I think Tom provided the story a way of explaining the hobbits journey from the innocence of their lives so far to maturing and growing to a point where they can handle the challenges of they are given.

3430,lotr,"Among Tolkien fans I feel there is an age old question, and I'm sure it's one that you yourselves have all grappled with over the years. ""Who is your favourite character in the Legendarium?"" Now I'm not going to try and answer that, it's entirely subjective, and everyone's going to have their own opinions. But throughout the many conversations I've had on this topic, there's one name that keeps on coming up again and again. And it's a curious choice, because this character appears so briefly in the Lord of the Rings, and he is only one of hundreds in the Silmarillion. Yet in spite of that, he is undeniably a fan favourite. And of course this character is Glorfindel. So the question is, what makes Glorfindel so much more special than the myriad of other Elves in the story? 

Well, if you were reading *The Lord of the Rings* when it was first published back in 1954, then Glorfindel might at first seem just like the many other Elves who get introduced and named, but then never appear again. Gildor Inglorion, Erestor, Galdor, and Lindir would be just a few more examples. However even in The Lord of the Rings Glorfindel does stand out from the crowd, and this is partly due to Tolkien's physical description of the Elven lord. Now Tolkien was notoriously reticent in describing what his characters actually look like. Pretty much all we get about Frodo is that he's a *""stout fellow with red cheeks,""* and something as simple as Legolas' hair colour has become a subject of intense debate amongst fans. But Glorfindel is an exception. Tolkien tells us that *""Glorfindel was tall and straight; his hair was of shining gold, his face fair and young and fearless and full of joy; his eyes were bright and keen, and his voice like music; on his brow sat wisdom, and in his hand was strength.""* So even in his first appearance, the dude does sound pretty perfect. 

But of course there is a whole lot *more* to Glorfindel than his looks, and in the Lord of the Rings his great claim to fame is that he's instrumental in getting Frodo safely across the Bruinen and away from the clutches of the Nazg√ªl. And there's no doubt that this is a big deal. If he'd failed then who knows what would have become of the ring and its bearer. But when it comes to the full extent of Glorfindel's contributions to Middle Earth, this is only the tip of the iceberg. It's eleven days in the life of a being who's older than the sun. 

So in order to tell the full story, we need to go back all the way to the First Age, and to the (arguably) greatest Elven city ever to exist in Middle Earth. The secret city of Gondolin. So Gondolin was ruled by King Turgon (the original owner of Gandalf's sword; Glamdring) and among Turgon's top warriors/advisors/friends was the chief of the House of the Golden Flower, Lord Glorfindel. 

Now alongside another inconceivably badass Elven lord called Ecthelion, Glorfindel was chosen to partake in all of King Turgon's most important ventures. He escorted Turgon's sister through the land of Shelob's siblings (which ended badly for everyone), he fought in the great Battle of Unnumbered Tears (which also ended badly for pretty much everyone), and he was there on the front lines when Gondolin came under attack and was eventually overrun. 

But unlike Ecthelion and Turgon himself, Glorfindel was not slain in the Fall of Gondolin. In fact he held his ground to the very end, and fought valiantly to allow time for the surviving refugees of (predominantly) women and children to flee the burning city. But still, Glorfindel did not die. He eventually followed the survivors and escaped the ruins of Gondolin. 

However, things swiftly turned from bad to worse when the refugees were ambushed on a high and narrow mountain path. And of all the evil things they could have been ambushed by, it was of course a balrog who appeared behind them. But all was not lost. Because the refugees still had Glorfindel. 

And Glorfindel proved his quality a thousand times over in this moment. He stabbed the balrog in the belly, and the demon fell from the mountainside, plummeting to its death in the abyss below. But, in its final seconds of life, the balrog reached out and grabbed Glorfindel by his golden hair, and so both balrog and Elven lord fell together off the edge of the cliff and perished. 

Now there are interesting parallels to be drawn here between Gandalf and Glorfindel, as they both died taking down a balrog in a murder suicide that involved falling. In fact Gothmog, the Lord of the Balrogs, and the mightiest of their order is also slain in the exact same way by that other awesome Elf Ecthelion. And just like Glorfindel and Gandalf, Ecthelion also died in the fall that killed the balrog. 

But anyway, in the year 510 of the First Age, Glorfindel tragically died. But, unlike most people, he didn't stay that way. 

Now this is where things get a little controversial, because in the books it remains unclear whether this Glorfindel of Gondolin is the same dude as Glorfindel of Rivendell, who features in The Lord of the Rings. And it certainly isn't beyond the realms of possibility that there might just be two separate Elves who share the name Glorfindel. I mean consider how many famous Johns there have been throughout our own history. And furthermore we know that Tolkien did recycle names in his Legendarium. In fact the elf who led the refugees away from Gondolin was one *Legolas Greenleaf,* and yet we know this is *not* the same Legolas who later joins the Fellowship in the Third Age. 

So how do we know that Glorfindel of Gondolin and Glorfindel of Rivendell are the same character? Well Tolkien actually tells us. You see in *The People's of Middle Earth* there is a chapter entitled the *Last Writings*, which is a collection of notes that were written only a year before Tolkien died. In fact these are the same notes that illuminate all those extra details about the Blue Wizards. And in this chapter Tolkien tells us that although people may have speculated that the two Glorfindels are different characters *""this repetition of so striking a name, though possible, would not be credible.""* And later, Tolkien goes on to write that *""After his* \[Glorfindel's\] *purging of any guilt that he had incurred in the rebellion, he was released from Mandos* \[the Elven equivalent of the Underworld\]*, and Manw√´ restored him‚Ä¶ We may then best suppose that Glorfindel returned* \[to Middle Earth\]*during the Second Age.""* 

Now this means that Glorfindel is one of the only Elves in the entire Legendarium who dies, but then gets reborn in the West and returns to Middle Earth with the permission of the Valar (gods and goddesses, sort of). In fact L√∫thien the Fair is the only other elf we know of with this distinction, but unlike Glorfindel, L√∫thien returned as a mortal, without the use of her former divine Maia powers. Glorfindel on the other hand comes back with *more* divine power than he ever possessed before. And he uses this Ainur light to drive the Nazg√ªl into the Bruinen where they are washed away by the great flood of Elrond and Gandalf. 

So this makes Glorfindel almost unique. Like so many others, he died in Middle Earth, and yet unlike all of them, he came back, better than ever. The *only* other character in the entire Legendarium with that kind of claim to fame is of course Gandalf the White. 

So there you go, Glorfindel is not just any other elf. Not by a longshot. And before I finish there is one more fun fact that I want to share with you, (although I reckon many of you will already know it.) 

You see throughout the Third Age, after he was resurrected, Glorfindel didn't do a huge amount in the grand scheme of things, but he was present for one last major battle. And this battle was in the ruins of Fornost, the former capital of the Kingdom of Arnor. And the great enemy of this battle was the Witch King of Angmar. Now this battle ended in victory for the Free Peoples, and after the Witch King's defeat, he fled south, back to the lands of Mordor. But before he fled, the Witch King looked upon a man called E√§rnur - the last King of Gondor. And the Witch King charged at him, and although E√§rnur held his ground, his horse was seized by the terror of the Witch King, and it turned and ran. And the Witch King mocked King E√§rnur for his cowardice, and E√§rnur was inclined to break ranks and chase after the Lord of the Nazg√ªl in reply. But Glorfindel held him back. He told E√§rnur to let the Witch King go, and he spoke the now famous words *""far off yet is his doom, and not by the hand of man will he fall.""* 

Now if we skip forward 1044 years, we'll arrive at another battle. The Battle of Pelennor Fields. And once again the Witch King will fight in it. And in his arrogance he will believe himself unkillable. After all *""not by the hand of man will he fall.""* But as we all know the Witch King does fall. And it isn't by the hand of man, but by the hands of a Halfling and a woman. Just as Glorfindel prophesied all those years ago. 

So, thank you all very much for reading this, I'd love to hear your thoughts and comments on this wonderful character below. As some of you may already know, I've been working on a series of YouTube videos about Tolkien's Legendarium. The series is called *Tolkien Untangled*, and there are plenty of video essays like this one as well as videos explaining the Silmarillion, and the differences between the Lord of the Rings books and movies. So check out *Tolkien Untangled* on YouTube if you'd like to learn more.

3445,lotr,"Hey! 

&amp;#x200B;

 So I'm not sure who's even going to be interested in this since it's an old game that I'm playing on the PS3 in the era of the PS5, but it was giving me hell and it was torture to find a solution so I thought I would just document it to help any other outliers revisiting this game.

&amp;#x200B;

 I've had WITN for 6 years and never made it past Mirkwood because of the damn glitch. To be specific,  I will relay broadly the details of the glitch as it has manifested itself in the past couple of days:

I play through Mirkwood, killing Wulfrun and picking up Radagast's staff, killing Saenathra and then freeing Radagast... except Beleram won't speak to me, and the next area won't unlock. I can leave via the portal at the end of the Heart Of The Web, but Mirkwood remains the last area unlocked. I can fight Saenathra over and over again, but the next area never unlocks. I triggered several saves and had no backup, so I was well and truly glitched. It's also worth pointing out that my quest log said ""Kill Wulfrun"", even though I was onto the Saenathra fight and Wulfrun would not respawn.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been trawling through forums and getting pretty frustrated at the state of the game, and also frustrated that the only solution anyone seems to offer is to join up with people online and co-op your way through it. Such an inelegant solution, especially for a 9 year old game. But I finally found another solution courtesy of user 'Memento2' in [this](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/991492-the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/68182630) thread. As it doesn't show up without very specific googling, I thought I would share it here too and hopefully make it more visible should myself or anyone else require it in future.

&amp;#x200B;

So the answer, which I have tested this morning and am so pleased to say was successful, is to go to Nordinbad and interact with the merchants (buy/sell/repair) in order to trigger a save. Then quit and delete any updates/patches and then load the game. Once the game has loaded and you are at the character select screen, reload manually (select button). Once you have manually loaded, pick a character and enter the game. In Nordinbad, look at your quest log. If it still says something wrong like ""Kill Wulfrun"", then quit the game. On the character select screen, manually load once again. Select another character. Check quest log. If it says something wrong, quit. Manually reload. Another character. Check. If wrong, this time you quit the game entirely and re-download the patch. Go through the process again, manually loading and then checking the quest log with different characters until there is no currently active main quest, and then travel to the Heart Of The Web to face Saenathra. When you get there, it should hopefully update your quest to ""search for the missing wizard Radagast"" or something like that. Fight Saenathra, talk to Beleram, and then you can hopefully go on to the next quest and circumvent this game-breaking bug.

&amp;#x200B;

To recap:

1 - Save the game in Nordinbad.

2 - Delete patches/updates.

3 - Load character select screen.

4 - MANUALLY load from character select screen.

5 - Check the quest log with each character, returning to the character select screen and manually loading between each. IF NO QUEST IS LISTED, proceed to step 7. Otherwise, carry on with step 6.

6 - Re-download patches/updates and repeat steps 3-5.

7 - Assuming that your quest log shows no current quest, go to Mirkwood - The Heart Of The Web, and fight Saenathra. Hopefully your quest should update as soon as you arrive in Mirkwood, before you even enter the fight.

&amp;#x200B;

 It's also worth noting that I skipped the cutscenes and dialogue, so you do not have to sit through them for this fix to work.

I have also watched 'An Unexpected Journey' and I've been thinking a lot about The Hobbit and the way it was adapted into a whole trilogy ‚Äì a very strange thing, to be sure, because it is a really short book.

Now, thinking about this, I started to remember that Peter Jackson initially planned the adaptation to be two movies, but Warner demanded a trilogy to be made so they could grab more cash at the box office.

Thing is, I really think The Hobbit should've been split only into two movies, which I would have called 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' and 'The Hobbit: There And Back Again', just as Jackson planned. Not only they would've served the book better, giving time for its happenings to flesh out and breathe, but also they would've had a lot less filler ‚Äì which is something that The Hobbit trilogy really suffered from.

For example, there are references to love between Aragorn and √âomer, Legolas and Gimli and Gimli and Pippin. These are of course friendships. Then there is the romantic love between Aragon and Arwen, Faramir and √âowyn and others.

But Gimli shows very strong emotions for Galadriel: he asks for a single strand of her hair as a gift, gets extremely upset when he thinks she didn't send him any messages through Gandalf, and gets overexcited when Gandalf delivers the message. These to me are clear signs of romantic love, but of course there is no romance between the two. So what is this type of love called and what are its historical and cultural roots in the real world?

3698,lotr,"So I finished the last chapter before it ends the first age and it explained the capture of Melkor/Morgoth but what really caught my attention was the fate of the three Silmarils. One is in custody by E√§rendil as he sails through the skies on his ship, the other ones were lost or should i say cast away to never be found again, one in the sea and on in the deep pits of Arda. Now the Silmaril that was cast into Middle earth is what I‚Äôm basing my theory off of. 

The Silmaril that was cast into the earth to forever be lost, had become encased in stone and rock in the mountain know to us as the lonely mountain or Erebor. When the dwarves of the lonely mountain dug what they call the Arkenstone it shone brilliantly through the darkness and had a everlasting beauty to it but it become a symbol of greed by the dwarf king at that time and again by Thorin Oakenshield (don‚Äôt know if I spelt that right). Now the Silmaril also has a beauty to it because of the light of the two trees of Arda but it also became a subject of greed for many people. When the Silmaril that Baren took from Morgoth it become in possession of an eleven king who asked dwarves to reforge a necklace fit the jewel into said necklace (I‚Äôm sure you all know I‚Äôm talking about the necklace of the dwarves) when the dwarves that we‚Äôre tasked to fit the Silmaril into the necklace they became greedy and tried to ‚Äúclaim the necklace as their own‚Äù but the elven king didn‚Äôt allow it and was killed for it. So that means the dwarves were inflicted with greed upon seeing the Silmaril, similar to how the Arkenstone inflicts greed into the dwarf kings that laid eyes upon it. 

Again this is just a theory and I don‚Äôt have any proof if it is the Simaril but it would be cool in my opinion it was. I know I probably made this sound confusing and for that I‚Äôm very sorry, I would love to hear you‚Äôre opinions on this",A little theory I came up with after getting to the end of the first age in the Silmarillion

3714,lotr,"The more I think about a woman being the ringbearer, the more it adds to the overall story.

If Frodo is female, it would explain why she would not fall prey to the ring so easily, because women aren't that interested in power (compared to men). And because women in general are a bit more gentle, not strong fighters but prefer diplomacy, it makes more sense that the Fellowhip was formed not only to guide her to Mount Doom but to protect her as well. And ofcourse earlier in the story when the Hobbits help Frodo move to Crickhollow.

It explains the pitty, trust, and attempt to redeem Gollum wheras everyone else is repulsed by the creature (Legolas, Gandalf,  Aragorn, Sam).

And finally, if Frodo was female there could be some sort of princess/stableboy lovestory happening. Because Frodo would be a rich lady (the bagginses were landowners right? A bit of an elite class of the Shire) and Samwise Gamgee is just her gardner (low class). A marriage between the two would perhaps be frowned upon under normal circumstances in the Shire, but the quest for the ring changes that. Gamgee is by her side all the way and the two fall deeply in love during their journey.

What do you think? Its not that I don't enjoy the story as it is now, but can't help feeling that making Frodo female is a missed opportunity for a strong female character (besides √âowyn and Galadriel).",Would it be better for the story if Frodo was a female character?

The powerful gifts to Frodo and Sam where also given by Galadriel not Celeborn.

Also when Fangorn (Treebeard), who seemed to hold Celeborn and Galdriel equally in high regard, asked if they'll meet again at their parting, Celeborn said he didn't know, while Galdriel gave a clear answer.

Finally, men of Gondor and Rohan seem to be suspicious and fearful of Galadriel and never mention Celeborn. And Gandalf sang a song praising Galadriel with no mention of Celeborn before using magic to silence Ggr√≠ma Wormtongue and help Th√©oden rejuvenate.

3790,lotr,,This amazing thing I got today.
3791,lotr,,Just rewatched the Hobbit-trilogy and something came to my mind...
3792,lotr,"So, in the Lord of the Rings, Gandalf the Gray journeys with the Fellowship into the cursed halls of Moria, where he eventually is drawn into battle with Durin's Bane; a  Balrog of Morgoth. Separated from the rest, he duels the demon for days, before finally slaying it, and then succumbing to his own wounds and exhaustion. For a time,  Olorin returns to Valinor, and recovers, but he cannot stay; Eru Illuvatar sends him back to Middle Earth to complete his mission, christening him Gandalf the White.

Gandalf returns to Middle-Earth, naked if I recall, and makes his way to Lothlorien; hoping to reconnoiter with the Fellowship, but they have already moved on, so Galadriel garbs him in their clothes (hence why his white robes are so fancy), and gifts him with an elven cloak, and his new staff. Then, Gandalf the White heads out to catch up with his comrades, which he does in Fangorn.

Where is all this pointless blathering going? Well, it gets us back to Glamdring. Gandalf had his fancy sword since the Hobbit, and it no doubt helped him best even the supernatural aura of the Balrog, but he lost it upon the mountain when he died. I don't personally know exactly where Gandalf respawned, before making his way to Lothlorien, but it seems almost odd his sword was just sitting there, waiting for him. No orcs or goblins found it, coming to explore the ruins of the epic clash? A naked Gandalf was able to slink around, unnoticed, to claim it, and then sneak away to Galadriel's home?

Obviously, I don't know, so I thought I'd check and see if Tolkien's writings ever touch on this? There's lots of lore and facts we only get from strange off-bits of his musings; the name Olorin, for one, or that Gandalf is an angelic being, of sorts, for two, so I didn't know if they ever discuss how Gandalf reclaimed his sword. He obviously has it later; it's put to some good use at various battles near Minas Tirith, and yet I've never read about the hunched old man scanning the peaks and pits of Moria to find it. I was reading on Elder Scrolls, of all things, about when Emperor Uriel V journeyed across the sea to Akaviir, and fell in battle. He had the Amulet of Kings, and none of his men reclaimed it from his corpse; they couldn't even confirm he was killed, and we've waited for a returning corrupted Uriel to invade Tamriel, at the head of an army of snake men (this was allegedly once the plot of Skyrim). He never returned, but the Amulet of Kings was available in the capitol for his eventual successor to claim, so that Uriel VII could have it, and die, at the beginning of Oblivion, so you could carry it to his son, and the plot of Oblivion. Since it never happened in an actual game, and even in books it is mostly just mentioned anecdotally, as history or legend, they never had to come up with an excuse. Uriel V never returned, and never gave the Amulet to someone to take for him, but he had to have it for the compact with Akatosh, and it wouldn't just blink back, or it wouldn't have been lost other times, in the past. I feel Gandalf's sword can sort of fall here, too.

Do the Unfinished Tales, Tolkien's letters, or some other lore ever describe Gandalf reclaiming Glamdring, after returning from Valinor? Sorry for the huge, pointless exposition; it's how I talk. ;)",Gandalf the White Wields Glamdring...How?

3795,lotr,"I already asked the question yesterday on another subreddit, but did not receive a satisfactory answer. 

&amp;#x200B;

English is not my mother tongue and I have never read Tolkien in the original, so please forgive me if there are some mistakes. 

&amp;#x200B;

If one assumes that the Glorfindel from Gondolin and the one from Rivendell are the same person, it becomes clear that the elves must be able to regain their physical form after death if they have not yet fulfilled their task. It seems to be accepted by most readers that Glorfindel has experienced rebirth and has already lived to the age of the trees. This means he was born at a similar time as Maedhros. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maedhros and Maglor are without question among the more tragic figures in Tolkien's creations. Although they are noble, kind and have similar traits like Fingon, for example, their tragic oath leads them to take part in crime and suffering. They seem to have more of their mother's temperament, while the other sons of Feanor take after their father. 

Especially Maglor seems to be the most balanced one and Maedhros has been for a long time, especially because of his deep friendship with his cousin Fingon. 

After Fingon's death, it becomes clear that Maedhros continues to shed his well-balanced temper and he urges his last living brother to fulfil the oath. 

 As both could no longer bear the pain and suffering, Maedhros finally killed himself and Maglor threw the Silmaril into the sea. I think Maglor's fate is a terrible one after all, to wander for ever alone at the shores. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because Maedhros was actually of gentle disposition, I think he did not feel comfortable in Mandos' halls, with all the people he killed, because of the oath and the kinslaying his father started. I also think that it made him unhappy that his younger brother, who had more strength than Feanor and his other sons, met the worst and saddest fate by throwing the Gem into the sea and being doomed to eternal loneliness . 

&amp;#x200B;

If Maedhros had returned to Middle-earth now - say sometime in the Third Age to search for his brother, how would his presence have changed the Third Age? 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course he would have gone to Rivendell, as he probably would have had a better relationship with Elrond than with Galadriel,only to learn that Elrond had not seen Maglor for thousands of years. 

&amp;#x200B;

How would he have been received? With Glorfindel in particular, there is the possibility that he was doomed to go over the Helcaraxe, on the other hand he would have seen how Maedhros had renounced the crown in favour of Fingolfin. 

&amp;#x200B;

Through the torture in Angband, Maedhros knew Sauron, would he perhaps have urged him to take action against him earlier? How would his presence have changed the Third Age? 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that the answers are speculative and more in the realm of fanfiction than canon, but nevertheless I find this consideration very interesting.",What if Maedhros returned to Middle Earth like Glorfindel?

The 1st King of the Noldor was Finw√´, whose sons were F√´anor, Fingolfin, and Finarfin. 

After the death of Finw√´, there was a brief power struggle. This struggle ended with Fingolfin being declared the 2nd King of the Noldor. 

The eldest sons of Fingolfin are Fingon and Turgon, who were in time each the 3rd and 4th Kings of the Noldor. 

Turgon is the father of Idris, who is the mother of √ãarendil. √ãarendil is the father of Elrond and Elros.

Elrond is married to Celebrian, daughter of Galadriel, daughter of Finarfen, brother of Fingolfin. Elrond is the father of Arwen.

Now, I suppose there is a generation difference here. Most of people here I suppose are young enough to have made your first acquaintance with Frodo through the films, but maybe there are some here, that like me read the books before the films (maybe not 10-15 times like me). I cannot really grasp what it must be like reading the books after seeing Jacksons films, but I guess you still make your own ""middle-earths"" after all.

Just having started to read the books after a needed pause after the films (15 years?) I find the reading exprerience enhanced, if something. Jackson filled in a couple of black spots for med. Like what an Uruk--Hai really looked like. 

Generally about the films - I found them really, really good! Normally, seeing the film after reading the book don't really work for me. There was an animated version in the 80's that really fell flat. But Jackson pulled it through. Of course, not all of it.

But here goes - Some parts I really enjoyed:  
Hobbiton and the birthday party in the beginning. It was more or less spot on, following the storyline well, Gandalf was more Gandalf than in my reading imagination and the scenery was really fabulous.   
Generally, everything upto Bree was to my liking. Of course, one was surprised when the hobbits just turned up at Bree, but with at little hindsight, Tom Bombadill was kind of impossible to put on film.  


I really liked the scenery at Rivendell, and apart that the actor for Elrond looks like a used car salesman  the Rivendell worked fine. 

Moria - the part where he dares some light and the grandeur of Kazad-dum is revealed was great.  


The river scenes, including Argonath was splendid, and the acquaintance with Orcs was a positive one, since my inner picture of orcs was a bit blurry. The head chopping was a little yeah-rrright but otherwise the Amon Hen was as good as my reading experience.

Gollum, of course.

Going into the second book the thirst for ""action movie"" was not to my liking, but still, there was some good stuff there. Generally, the nature scenes in Rohan and Orthanc was grand, generally all dealings with the Rohan people, Theoden, Eowyn and so was above my own reading experience. And Saruman was great. The palantir scenes did their jobs.  


Minas Tirith, you got to love the scenery,  the scene where the Beacons get lit to muster Rohan, with the fires popping up all over the mountains is probably the one scene which gave me the greatest ""wow""-experience.  

As for Frodos and Sams dealings in mordor, Shelob and the Mount Doom scene did their job well. 

Turning to the NEGATIVES:

Of course, like most Tolkien fans seeing the film, Bree came suddenly, but again, Tom Bombadill is probably impossible.  


No, most was more or less all and well in the first film, until Lorien. What a disappointment! I guess its a little the same as with Tom, that the magic is hard to translate, but it felt SO low-budget compared to my dream-like experience of the home of Galadriel and Celeborn. OK, the Galadriel's mirror scene, and the farewell from lorien-scene was pretty ok. Reading that part again, actually two weeks ago kind of reinstated the splendour of Lorien. For me.  


Bug generally, the first film was far beyond my expectations.

So not the second. Hollywood, and the crave for action and blood was obvious. Helms Deep is like 11 pages in the book but was like half an hour in the film. The wargs and the orcs attacking Aragon, legolas and Gimli when pursuing the hobbit's kidnappers - too much.  


And then the second greatest disappointment in the films in parallel with Lorien - Treebeard and the Ents. Those magnificent creatures, and that magical part of the second book, in Fangorn forest just fell flat. It feels like Jackson got orders from the money people to go for the killings and cut down on the magic.

My expectations for the last film was pretty low, but it was far better than the second. Still, the Denethor scene was like something from Ingemar Bergman, and Aragorn meeting the oathbreakers got a little over the edge with the skull-rain and all that.  


Legolas was EXTREMELY skillfull in the great battle, and well, I could have done with a third of all battling going on in the last film. Still, that's what people crave for, I guesss I'm too soft.  


I would have loved half an hour of battling being cut out in favor of the great part in the book with the travelling home to the Shire after the big wars.   


Well, thats my opinions. I would just love to read yours!","If you compare the Films with the Books, what parts do you find good in the films (Spoiler)"

But given the divine plan was for a hobbit to find it, I wonder if this plan was first given form by it coming to the hobbit-like Deagol, and it was the intervention of Smeagol that turned that plan aside for a few hundred years only for it to reoccur with Bilbo.

Also wonder whether in some way Gandalf's rather eccentric plan to involve Bilbo in the quest for erebor was an unconscious promoting that was only ever really about getting him to the misty mountains and the ring.",Was Deagol a first attempt at Bilbo?

There he said farewell to Eldarion, and gave into his hands the winged crown of Gondor and the sceptre of Arnor; and then all left him save Arwen, and she stood alone by his bed‚Ä¶
‚Äò‚Äú Estel, Estel!‚Äù she cried, and with that even as he took her hand and kissed it, he fell into sleep. Then a great beauty was revealed in him, so that all who after came there looked on him in wonder; for they saw that the grace of his youth, and the valour of his manhood, and the wisdom and majesty of his age were blended together. And long there he lay, an image of the splendour of the Kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.""

# Accolades

Whilst conversing with his other self (i.e. Smeagol), Gollum muses that with the power of the One Ring, he could become stronger than the Nazgul:

&gt;*""No, sweet one. See, my precious: if we has it, then we can escape, even from Him, eh? Perhaps we grows very strong, stronger than Wraiths. Lord Sm√©agol? Gollum the Great? The Gollum! Eat fish every day, three times a day, fresh from the sea. Most Precious Gollum! Must have it. We wants it, we wants it, we wants it!""* ***‚Äî The Two Towers: The Passage of the Marshes.***

Not only does Gollum muse that he could become ""**stronger than Wraiths**"" but he also muses that he could become **""Lord Smeagol**"" ... ""**Gollum the Great**"" ... ""**The Gollum!**"" and will able to ""**Eat fish every day, three times a day, fresh from the sea**"" which suggests that Gollum hasn't reached his full potential and that only the One Ring can unlock that potential.

# Strength

Although it felt soft (which is easily attributable to Gollum's skin being tainted by poor hygiene), Gollum's grip over Samwise Gamee, is described as ""**horribly strong**"" and he squeezed Sam ""**like slowly tightening cords**"" during their first clash:

&gt;*""Before Sam could get a hold, long legs and arms were wound round him pinning his arms, and a clinging grip, soft but horribly strong, was squeezing him like slowly tightening cords; clammy fingers were feeling for his throat.""* ***‚Äî The Two Towers: The Taming of Sm√©agol.***

# Speed &amp; Agility

Samwise Gamgeee finds that an Gollum was ""**more than bargained before**"" despite Gollum ""**suddenly**"" being caught ""**off his guard off his fall**"" by Sam's surprise attack, and Gollum displays enough fast reaction to grab hold of Sam ""**before Sam could get a hold**"" of Gollum, indicating that Gollum is faster than Sam because Sam had the element of surprise in that he launched an unexpected attack on an unsuspecting Gollum that caught him off guard:

&gt;*""Sam was out of his hiding in a flash and crossed the space between him and the cliff-doot in a couple of leaps. Before Gollum could get up, he was on top of him. But he found Gollum more than he bargained before, even taken like that, suddenly, off his guard off his fall. Before Sam could get a hold, long legs and arms were wound round him pinning his arms, and a clinging grip, soft but horribly strong, was squeezing him like slowly tightening cords; clammy fingers were feeling for his throat.""* ***‚Äî The Two Towers: The Taming of Sm√©agol.***

# Durability

Gollum shrugs off getting head butted by Samwise Gamgee:

&gt;*""Then sharp teeth bit into his shoulder. All he could do was butt his hard round head sideways into the creature's face. Gollum hissed and spat, but he did not let go.""* ***‚Äî The Two Towers: The Taming of Sm√©agol.***

3948,lotr,"There are few characters in the Lord of the Rings who are more crucial to the plot than Aragorn. He‚Äôs a guide to the Hobbits, a champion to the Rohirrm, and a king to the Men of Gondor. In fact of the six books that make up the Lord of the Rings, more of them feature Aragorn than either Frodo or the Ring. In his first appearance at the Prancing Pony, he is simply Strider of the wilderness. But only seven months later, he is crowned King Elessar of the D√∫nedain. So how does a ranger from the North become king in the South? And what exactly was Aragorn doing in the eighty-seven years leading up to it? 

So in order to fully understand how a ranger can become a king, we first need to go all the way back to the moment of Aragorn‚Äôs birth. Because just like his father and grandfather before him, Aragorn was actually born into royalty. His ancestors were kings. His name literally means ‚Äú*Revered King*‚Äù. And yet Aragorn was born with no lands to rule. He was an Heir of Isildur, but he had no kingdom to inherit. All he had was his name.  

You see back in the early Third Age, the proud Kingdom of Arnor - the Kingdom of Elendil and Isildur - fell to the power of the Witch-king. Almost a thousand years before Aragorn was even born, the kings of both Arnor and Gondor were wiped out, and all that remained of Isildur‚Äôs descendants were the humble Chieftains of the D√∫nedain. The Chieftains of the Rangers of the North. And at the time of Aragorn‚Äôs birth, these rangers had fallen on hard times. 

So just as Aragorn is an Heir of Isildur, so too was his father Arathorn, and his grandfather Arador. But unfortunately, being an Heir of Isildur comes with its fair share of dangers. You see, although the strength of the D√∫nedain had significantly waned since the days of Isildur, the very fact that they still existed, made them a threat to Sauron. And Sauron knew it. He feared the heirs of the man who cut the ring from his finger, and so as long as the Dark Lord endured, the Heirs of Isildur were not safe.

The year before Aragorn was born, his grandfather Arador was captured and killed by trolls of the Coldfells. And only three years later, Aragorn‚Äôs father, Arathorn, was slain by an orc arrow through the eye. So, when Aragorn was only two years old, he became the *last* surviving Heir of Isildur. Eighty-five years before the Lord of the Rings, the future of the D√∫nedain rested upon the fate of a baby. A baby who was destined to be king. 

Now, over the course of Aragorn‚Äôs story we‚Äôll see that there are a number of notable symmetries between Aragorn, and two of his (exceedingly) distant ancestors from the First Age ‚Äì Beren and Tuor. You see all three of these guys were mighty rulers of Men, who‚Äôd had their realms conquered by the Enemy before they were full-grown. All three of them lost their fathers at a young age, and crucially, all three of them went on to take an exceptional Elf as their bride. Now it‚Äôs hardly an essential detail, but I will point out that Aragorn and his ancestor Tuor *both* lost their respective fathers to a poisoned orc arrow through the eye, within just a year or so of being born. Now I‚Äôm not really sure if this is a thought-provoking parallel, or just a strangely specific coincidence, but either way, it is kind of interesting.

Anyway, the real question here revolves around why Aragorn grows up to be a king of the D√∫nedain, when all the previous Heirs of Isildur were simply chieftains. What did Aragorn have that his ancestors didn‚Äôt?  

So it obviously goes without saying that Aragorn did indeed survive his childhood, but he didn‚Äôt do so as a Ranger of the North. You see, Aragorn‚Äôs mother was a woman called Gilraen, and with Arathorn dead, Gilraen brought her son, in secret, to the Elven refuge of Rivendell. And there, Aragorn first met Lord Elrond. Now if you‚Äôre primarily familiar with the Lord of the Rings movies, then you may be of the understanding that Elrond and Aragorn have a bit of an uneasy relationship, but in Tolkien‚Äôs writings, this couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. 

Tolkien tells us ‚Äú*Elrond took the place of his father and came to love him as a son.‚Äù* He raised Aragorn in Rivendell as one of ‚Äú*his own*,‚Äù and although Aragorn was too young to retain any memory of Arathorn or his life among the Rangers, in the House of Elrond, Aragorn grew up to be *‚Äúelven-wise‚Äù.* And this is certainly a big deal in explaining Aragorn‚Äôs rise from ranger to king, but it‚Äôs not something that‚Äôs unique to Aragorn. It was a in fact a tradition amongst the D√∫nedain for the Heirs of Isildur to be fostered by the Elves in Rivendell. And both Arathorn and Arador also spent their childhoods with Lord Elrond. But in Aragorn‚Äôs case, there was something different. 

You see, it was decided by the Wise that Aragorn‚Äôs name and lineage should be kept a secret until he came of age. Not only would this protect the last Heir of Isildur from the dangers of the outside world, but it also prevented Sauron from learning of his existence. And so, throughout all of Aragorn‚Äôs formative years, he was known simply as *Estel* ‚Äì which means ‚Äòtrust‚Äô and ‚Äòhope‚Äô in the Elvish language. 

And to be honest, Tolkien doesn‚Äôt tell us very much about Aragorn‚Äôs boyhood, but I reckon it must have been pretty amazing. I mean just imagine what it would be like for a mortal Man to be raised entirely amongst Elves. We‚Äôre told that by the time Aragorn was twenty, he was ‚Äú*fair and noble and was early come to manhood.‚Äù* And just like his father and grandfather before him, Aragorn developed a cherished friendship with Elrond‚Äôs twin sons, the Elven rangers Elladan and Elrohir. In fact, in his youth Aragorn ventured off into the wilds with these adoptive brothers, and I imagine it was at this time that he developed many of the skills we‚Äôll later see during the Lord of the Rings. We know that Aragorn is a gifted ranger, and an excellent tracker, and an exceptional healer, and yet he didn‚Äôt acquire these skills from the D√∫nedain. Instead, Aragorn‚Äôs abilities come from the Elves. 

However, Aragorn‚Äôs youthful days as Estel did of course have to come to an end, and when he turned twenty-one, and ‚Äú*returned to Rivendell after great deeds in the company of the sons of Elrond‚Äù,* it was time for Estel to learn the truth. So in the year 2952, Lord Elrond called Aragorn by his true name for the first time, and he presented Aragorn with heirlooms from the House of Isildur. Now of these heirlooms, three are particularly important in explaining Aragorn‚Äôs journey from ranger to king. One of these heirlooms is the broken blade Narsil, which was of course used to cut the One Ring from Sauron‚Äôs finger, and will of course one day be reforged into And√∫ril; and another heirloom is the Ring of Barahir, which is the same ring that we see Aragorn wearing in the movies. Now this ring has a bit of a crazy history, and it‚Äôs very possibly the single oldest piece of jewellery in Middle-earth. It predates the Rings of Power by thousands of years, and it‚Äôs even older than the sun and the moon. And unfortunately there‚Äôs nowhere near enough time to fully explain how this ring ended up in Isildur‚Äôs possession, but way back, possibly around ten thousand years ago, its original owner was actually Galadriel‚Äôs older brother. And he gave this ring to a mortal Man called Barahir. And as it goes, Barahir was the father of Aragorn‚Äôs First Age ancestor Beren. So this Ring of Barahir is a big deal, and it‚Äôs a hugely significant part of Aragorn‚Äôs family history. 

Now the last heirloom of Isildur‚Äôs that Elrond had in his possession was a silver rod called the Sceptre of Ann√∫minas. And this Sceptre of Ann√∫minas was also ancient, and it originally belonged to Elendil - the first High King of the D√∫nedain. The sceptre was both an artefact of N√∫menor and a symbol of the Ancient Kings of Men. But unlike the Shards of Narsil and the Ring of Barahir, Elrond did not give the Sceptre of Ann√∫minas to Aragorn. For Aragorn was not yet a king. Instead he told his adopted son that the Sceptre *‚ÄúI withhold, for you have yet to earn it.‚Äù* But he also told Aragorn *‚Äúthat the span of your life shall be greater than the measure of Men, unless evil befalls you or you fail at the test.‚Äù* 

Now this test is very important. In fact I would argue that it is critical in understanding Aragorn‚Äôs journey from ranger to king. And it‚Äôs also critical in unravelling the character of Aragorn in the books from Aragorn in the movies. 

So I feel most people will agree that Viggo Mortensen did a fantastic job at portraying Aragorn in Peter Jackson‚Äôs films; I personally don‚Äôt have a bad thing to say about him. But the way that the character is written in the movies is very different from how he‚Äôs written in the books. You know, in the movies he‚Äôs afflicted with doubt about his destiny, but Tolkien actually tells us that after learning the truth of his heritage, Aragorn‚Äôs *‚Äúheart was high within him‚Ä¶for he was full of hope.‚Äù* It seems that Aragorn agreed with his adoptive father‚Äôs assertion that the kingship had to be earned. And I believe that this desire to earn his destiny, and to prove himself worthy of Isildur and his heirs, is a critical part of what motivates Aragorn throughout the next six decades of his life. 

However, before I get too far ahead of myself, there‚Äôs one more character that needs to be introduced to this story. Because although Elrond, and Elladan, and Elrohir are all crucial players in Aragorn‚Äôs youth, there‚Äôs one more member of their family who‚Äôs remained conspicuously absent up until this point. 

You see, *literally* the very next day after learning the truth about his lineage, Aragorn went out into the woods for a solitary walk. And whilst he was out, he began singing a song called the *Lay of L√∫thien,* which tells the story of how that distant ancestor Beren, first encountered the angelic Elf-maiden L√∫thien, AKA his future wife. Now there‚Äôs definitely more than one example of symmetry between Aragorn and Beren, but right here we see what is perhaps the most striking one. Because we‚Äôre told that while Aragorn was singing this song about Beren and L√∫thien, ‚Äú*L√∫thien walked before his eyes in Rivendell.‚Äù* And I feel like this must have been an incredibly surreal moment for Aragorn; partly because L√∫thien was his grandmother 67 times removed, and also partly because she‚Äôd been dead for 6480 years by this point. Also she lived thousands of miles away in a part of the world that doesn‚Äôt even exist anymore, so you probably don‚Äôt need me to tell you that it turns out, Aragorn was mistaken. The woman who stood before him ‚Äú*clad in a mantle of silver and blue, fair as the twilight‚Äù* was not in fact the ghost of L√∫thien, but instead she was her great great granddaughter. Arwen Und√≥miel.

Now we all know that Arwen‚Äôs father was Aragorn‚Äôs adoptive father, and we all know that Arwen‚Äôs brothers were Aragorn‚Äôs adoptive brothers, but thankfully, Arwen and Aragorn never had any sort of brother/sister relationship. And this is because, throughout Aragorn‚Äôs first twenty-one years of life, Arwen had been entirely absent from Rivendell. Instead of living with her father and brothers, she‚Äôd been living far away in Lothl√≥rien, with her grandparents Galadriel and Celeborn. And so, only one day after learning the truth about his heritage, Aragorn met Arwen for the very fist time. And Tolkien tells us that in this moment, Aragorn believed he‚Äôd ‚Äú*strayed into a dream.‚Äù*

Now, apparently Aragorn isn‚Äôt particularly great at hiding his emotions, because ‚Äú*in the* *days that followed‚Äù* both his mother Gilraen, and Lord Elrond, ‚Äú*perceived that some strange thing had come over him.‚Äù* And although I don‚Äôt believe Elrond was exactly thrilled about his adoptive son falling in love with his only daughter, he wasn‚Äôt quite as grumpy about it as he is in the movies. We‚Äôre told that Elrond said to Aragorn ‚Äú*the years will bring what they will. We will speak no more of this until many have passed.‚Äù* And it appears that Aragorn agreed to his adoptive father‚Äôs terms, because the very next day after this conversation, ‚Äú*he took leave lovingly of Elrond,‚Äù* and disappeared into the wild for nearly thirty years!  

And I guess these years mark a really significant turning point in Aragorn‚Äôs life. Because up until this departure, he‚Äôd lived his whole life as Estel, but in the space of only a few days, Aragorn had learned the truth about his ancestry, he‚Äôd inherited two out of three heirlooms of Isildur‚Äôs, and he‚Äôd come face to face with the woman he‚Äôd eventually end up marrying.  And so I believe it‚Äôs during these years in the wilderness that Estel of Rivendell truly grows into Aragorn of the D√∫nedain. And Tolkien actually gives us some really cool details about what Aragorn was getting up during these long years in the wild.  

So for the first four years of his travels, it seems that Aragorn stayed in the North, and he explored the lands of his ancestors and his kin. And it‚Äôs during these years of wandering the North that Aragorn first encountered his future friend, Gandalf the Grey. And it was actually upon the wizard‚Äôs advice that Aragorn first began to take an interest in the secretive northern realm known as the Shire. Over the course of his travels, the Men of the North came to know Aragorn by reputation, but he kept his true identity a secret from all save his fellow rangers. And so, as the years went on Aragorn became known in the North as Strider. And this is a name he‚Äôll carry with him for the rest of his life. In fact when Aragorn eventually does become King Elessar, he adopts the name Telcontar as the name of his Royal House, and his family name. And what Telcontar literally means is simply Strider, in the Quneya language of the High Elves. 

Anyway, while Aragorn lingered in the North, all was not well in the South. Only a few years after he left Rivendell, ‚Äú*Mount Doom burst into flame‚Äù,* and in the very same year that Aragorn learned of his lineage, ‚Äú*Sauron declared himself openly‚Ä¶*\[and\] *began the rebuilding of Barad-d√ªr.‚Äù* So at the age of just twenty-six, Aragorn undertook his first great journey into the South, and for the first time in his life, he passed into the lands of Rohan and Gondor. And for the next twenty-three years, Aragorn aided the Free Peoples of the West, in their renewed war against Sauron.

In fact, it was during this time, that Aragorn first encountered a few familiar faces from the Lord of the Rings, including a nine-year-old Th√©oden, and a twenty-seven year old Denethor. However just as he did while living in the North, Aragorn kept his heritage and his true name a secret. And so to the Men of Rohan and Gondor, Aragorn became known as Thorongil, which means *The Eagle of the Star, ‚Äúfor he was swift and keen-eyed, and wore a silver star upon his cloak.‚Äù*  

Now, Tolkien doesn‚Äôt tell us very much about Thorongil‚Äôs exploits in Rohan, except that for some time he rode alongside Th√©oden‚Äôs father King Tengel. But he does give us some very cool details about what Thorongil got up to in Gondor. You see Denethor‚Äôs father, and Boromir‚Äôs grandfather, was the Steward Ecthelion, and we‚Äôre told that Ecthelion was ‚Äú*a man of wisdom‚Äù* who *‚Äúbegan to strengthen his realm against the assault of Mordor.‚Äù* And so, Ecthelion encouraged *‚Äúall men of worth‚Äù* to come to Minas Tirith and to enter his service. And of course the captain that Ecthelion ‚Äú*loved above all‚Äù* was Thorongil. 

Now Thorongil certainly made a name for himself in Minas Tirith, and his greatest achievement came during his campaign against Gondor‚Äôs ancestral enemies, the Corsairs of Umbar. Tolkien tells us that with Ecthelion‚Äôs leave, Throrongil ‚Äú*gathered a small fleet‚Äù* and sailed into Umbar under the cover of night. There he ‚Äú*burned* *a great part of the ships of the Corsairs‚Äù* and he even killed their Captain in single combat upon the quays. However when the time came for the victorious fleet of Gondorians to return to Minas Tirith, and to receive the favour of Ecthelion, Thorongil departed, and he journeyed alone towards the Mountains of Mordor. And as it turns out, Aragorn would not set foot in Minas Tirith again, until he came to the Houses of Healing after the Battle of Pelennor Fields. 

You see, although pretty much everyone in Gondor absolutely loved Thorongil, there was one person who didn‚Äôt. And that person was that Ecthelion‚Äôs son and heir, Denethor. Now we‚Äôre told that Denethor was ‚Äú*subtle in mind and looked further and deeper than other men of his day.‚Äù* And it‚Äôs implied that Denethor was the only one who discovered the truth about Thorongil‚Äôs identity. And it seems he feared that Thorongil would one day supplant him as the future ruler of Gondor. Which technically, he wasn‚Äôt wrong to worry about. 

But anyway just before I move one, there‚Äôs one more potentially really lovely detail here. Because two years before Aragorn‚Äôs battle with the Corsairs, Denethor‚Äôs wife gave birth to their first son. And this son is of course Boromir. So it‚Äôs very possible that perhaps Aragorn and Boromir may have met, right at the beginning of Boromir‚Äôs life. Perhaps Aragorn even held him as a baby. Now it‚Äôs incredibly unlikely that Boromir would ever have known about this, but if we skip forward just under forty years to the end of Boromir‚Äôs life, then we‚Äôll find that Aragorn is there once again, holding Boromir in his arms as he dies. It‚Äôs another really beautiful moment of potential symmetry. 

Anyway, after leaving Gondor and Rohan, Aragorn‚Äôs life once again becomes a bit of a mystery. Tolkien tells us that he ventured southeast, and he even journeyed into the lands around Mordor. We know that he explored ‚Äú*the hearts of men good and evil‚Äù* and he discovered many of the ‚Äú*plots and devices‚Äù* that were contrived by the servants of Sauron. However beyond that, Aragorn‚Äôs odyssey through the lands of the Enemy remains a mystery. 

But eventually, Aragorn‚Äôs days of wandering the wilds did come to an end. And at the ripe old age of forty-nine, Aragorn returned from the lands of shadow to seek rest and recuperation once again with the Elves. However this time it wasn‚Äôt Elrond or his sons in Rivendell that Aragorn sought shelter with, but instead, he came to the hidden realm of Lothl√≥rien, where he first encountered the Lady Galadriel and her husband Celeborn. 

Now, I guess it‚Äôs fair to say that when Aragorn first arrived in Lothl√≥rien he probably wasn‚Äôt looking his best. I mean he‚Äôd just spent a good deal of time wandering around ‚Äú*the dark confines of Mordor‚Äù* so I imagine he wasn‚Äôt really dressed to impress. But, good old Galadriel perceived that Aragorn was now ‚Äú*grown to full stature of body and mind‚Äù,* and so she gave him what I can really only describe as a makeover. We‚Äôre told that Galadriel ‚Äú*clothed him in silver and white, with a cloak of elven-grey and a bright gem upon his brow.‚Äù* And this restyling is important, because what happens next is the final catalyst in Aragorn‚Äôs journey from ranger to king.   

You see, what Aragorn did not know, was that in the nearly thirty years since he‚Äôd left Rivendell, Arwen had also travelled back to Lothl√≥rien. And she just so happened to be there at the same time as Aragorn. And this is where we see a lovely little reversal of Aragorn and Arwen‚Äôs first encounter all those years ago. Because it‚Äôs while Arwen is out walking beneath the golden trees of her grandparent‚Äôs realm, that she and Aragorn are once again reunited. And because Aragorn is dressed in the fine raiment that Galadriel gave him, Arwen at first mistakes him for an ‚Äú*Elf-lord from the Isles of the West.‚Äù* And so, it‚Äôs in this moment that Arwen makes the all-important choice that will decide not only her fate, but also the fate of the D√∫nedain. 

You see, for one whole season Aragorn and Arwen ‚Äú*wandered together in the glades of Lothl√≥rien.‚Äù* And on Midsummer‚Äôs Eve, Aragorn removed the Ring of Barahir from his finger, and he presented it to Arwen, as a symbol of their betrothal. 

Now when Elrond learned of his daughter‚Äôs engagement, I think it‚Äôs fair to say he was somewhat conflicted, but he certainly didn‚Äôt blame Aragorn for Arwen‚Äôs choice. And thirty years after their original conversation about Aragorn‚Äôs love for his daughter, Elrond said to his adopted son ‚Äú*though I love you, I say to you: Arwen Und√≥miel shall not diminish her life‚Äôs grace for‚Ä¶any Man less than the King of both Gondor and Arnor.‚Äù* 

And so, with that sentence, Elrond set in motion the return of the King. To earn the love of Arwen Und√≥miel ‚Äú*Aragorn went forth again to danger and toil.‚Äù* And the next time he crops up in the story is just after the eleventy-first birthday party of Bilbo Baggins. Now Aragorn does go on one more epic adventure to hunt down Gollum before showing up in Prancing Pony, but this pretty much catches us up with the Strider that we‚Äôre all familiar with from the Fellowship of the Ring.

So, let‚Äôs think back for a moment to those three heirlooms of Isildur‚Äôs. By the time of the Lord of the Rings, the Ring of Barahir belonged to Arwen, the Sceptre of Ann√∫minas was kept by Elrond, and the reforged shards of Narsil were borne by Aragorn. Over the next three months, Aragorn undertook his second great journey from Rivendell to Gondor. And although he definitely took his sweet time in getting there, when Aragorn finally did arrive at Minas Tirith, aboard the Black Ships of the Corsairs, he brought hope (pun intended) to the Fields of Pelennor. Now I know in the movies Aragorn just kind of shows up with an Army of the Dead, but in Tolkien‚Äôs writings, the Oathbreakers had already served their purpose by then. Instead, Aragorn arrived at the battle with the twin sons of Elrond, a company of Rangers from the North, and an army of reinforcements from the Outlands of Gondor. Just as all hope seemed lost for the Men of the West, Aragorn unfurled the black and silver standard of Elendil and Isildur - a standard that had been stitched for him by Arwen - and he led his people to victory. He brought the sword that was broken to the City of Kings, and he revealed to Sauron that Isildur‚Äôs Heir had finally returned. 

And only ten days later, Sauron was destroyed with the One Ring. Only forty-five days later, Aragorn was crowned king. And only three months later, Arwen and Elrond arrived in Minas Tirith where they beheld King Elessar for the first time. The three heirlooms of Isildur‚Äôs House were finally reunited. 

At Aragorn‚Äòs side lay And√∫ril. Upon Arwen‚Äôs finger sat the Ring of Barahir. And in Elrond‚Äôs hand was the Sceptre of Ann√∫minas. So, on Midsummer‚Äôs Eve, thirty-nine years to the day since his daughter‚Äôs betrothal in Lothl√≥rien, Elrond finally presented the Sceptre of Ann√∫minas to his adopted son. And the very next day, Arwen married the High King of the D√∫nedain.  

So if we look back now to our original questions, how does a ranger become a king? I guess what the answer ultimately boils down to, is love. What did Aragorn have that his ancestors didn‚Äôt? Well, in terms of heritage and birthright and upbringing, they were all pretty much the same. But Aragorn had the love of Arwen. Aragorn earned her hand in marriage, and so for the sake of spending his life with the Elf-maiden he loved, Aragorn united the ancient Kingdoms of the D√∫nedain, and he fulfilled his destiny as Isildur‚Äôs Heir. 

For one hundred and twenty-two years, Aragorn ruled alongside his Queen, and together they founded a new dynasty for the D√∫nedain that lasted long into the Fourth Age. And when his time finally did come, Aragorn walked the Silent Street of Minas Tirith, he lay down in his bed, and with his family at his side, he allowed himself to die. Arwen endured a single winter of grief without her husband, and she journeyed alone into the east until she came back to the now empty lands of Lothl√≥rien. And there, she too ‚Äú*laid herself to rest‚Äù,* and she joined her husband in death. 

Throughout the Legendarium there are loads of kings. Some are great. Some are terrible. Some are in-between. But I would argue that there‚Äôs no other king in Middle-earth‚Äôs history who truly earns his right to rule in the same way that Aragorn does. He was born into a *‚Äúragged house long bereft of lordship"",* but in the years between meeting Arwen, and eventually marrying her, Aragorn redeemed the House of Isildur, he united the Men of the West, and he ruled as the High King of all D√∫nedain. 

So, thank you all very much for reading this, I'd love to hear your thoughts and comments on this amazing character. As some of you may know, I've been working on a series of YouTube videos about Tolkien's Legendarium. The series is called *Tolkien Untangled*, and there are plenty of video essays like this one as well as videos explaining the Silmarillion, and the differences between the Lord of the Rings books and movies. So check out *Tolkien Untangled* on YouTube if you'd like to learn more.

For instance I know most of dwarves never even end up getting married or falling in love, women in their society is scarce in comparison and men don't seem to care that much. 

Elves always give this very sophisticated aura; like they are above it all, as earthly pleasures wouldn't mean much for them; we know they fall in love, get married, and have children but they live for thousands of years but they have very few children; which makes me imagine them as only having one respectful intercourse with their spouse only with the purpose of reproduction and never do it again after a baby elf is born. Ridiculous maybe, I know. 

I guess what I am asking is, were there any clues in some book, some essay, in some unfinished tale about this subject? Or is it completely left to our interpretations?",Do elves even have sex at all?

I'm reading Tolkien again. I'm impressed with how much more elegant his prose is, and how beautifully constructed the world is. Characters are mythologically-inspired and, in that sense, archetypical and somewhat flat. It's a magical read. It's inspiring. It's transcendent.

In comparison, GRRM seems gritty, mundane, but also *real*. His characters change often, but never implausibly. They are in conflict with themselves and the conflict is not resolved in a linear arc, unlike the neat dilemmas of Tolkien's characters. Westeros is often gross and coarse.

GRRM's work does not inspire in me a sense of poetry, or beauty, or tranquility, or a longing for a lost place or a lost time. But it's somewhat easier to relate to, because it's inherently *human*.

Tolkien, I think, is unsurpassed as a *world-builder* and a superior ~~writer~~ wordsmith; whereas GRRM nails character development and manipulating the reader's emotions.

I like them both. You?

Had previously finished the fellowship of the ring twice and gave up.

I love how we actually get a deeper understanding of Gondor, the state it‚Äôs in, the fact it is still a huge realm with plenty of capable captains, Prince Imrahil to name one.

I also enjoyed the depiction of Frodo so much more and now hate even more the fact that Frodo tells Sam to turn away in the movies. Although Frodo does have certain spasms(?) with the ring, he quickly overrides these. His journey was much more enjoyable.

3996,lotr," We all know of the 4K UHD version this december, and the Ultimate Collector‚Äôs Edition of next summer. But I haven't found much info or discussion about the 2021 fall version.

This is what I've read on [theonering.net](https://www.theonering.net/torwp/2020/10/07/108839-uhd-4k-lotr-and-hobbit-announced-a-special-message-from-sean-astin/):

&gt;*Additionally, to celebrate the 20th¬†anniversary of the first* ***The Lord of the Rings*** *film, a newly remastered Blu-ray trilogy of* ***The Lord of the Rings*** *films will be available in the Fall of 2021, also including the theatrical and extended versions.* 

Which frankly, worries me a bit.

I want to jump on the 4K right now, but that remastered version is calling me, as if *I have awoken, I've heard my master's call.* I love LOTR but I can see where the effects aged a bit, but I don't want my favorite movies to end up with the CGI of the Hobbit in a *George Lucas like* move

But seriously, I'm really curious about the result of that remastered version.

What are they going to remaster?  
Would it be CGI on top of some practical effects?  
Are we going to get both the original and remastered versions from the same set of discs?

I wish there was more information because I really want to buy the 4K version of december, but it is not little money, and I know the remastered won't be exactly cheap but I can wait if it's worth it.

And it bugs me because, lord knows why, I think it is kinda of a big deal to have a 20th Anniversary Edition that is newly remastered. But I don't see many people commenting on that, just on the other two upcoming versions.",20th Anniversary Edition (Newly Remastered version)

4014,lotr,"Middle Earth was not a time and place in some forgotten distant past, of ancient creatures and peoples, but rather the resultant of a post apocalyptic world, far far into the future?

Scientists had finally decoded and modified the aging gene through CRISPR; humans could live hundreds or even thousands of years.  Humans could be made more precisely... and enhanced with greater abilities.  Scientists are able to tap into the secrets of the most efficient power supplies (photosynthesis, solar energy).  Experiments with the plant genome were taking place.  We were, at long last, becoming a tier 1 civilization.

But not everyone had these technological advances.  And it was these advances themselves that were becoming a threat to Industries.  Coupled with dwindling resources, a dying planet and conflicting ideals, conditions were ripe for an only consequence. 

No one knew who launched the first nuclear missiles.  It was a domino effect.  Billions died.  But life is haughty.  Survivors took refuge from the nuclear fallout into the mountains, caves and even underground.  And then came The Ice Age.  It was a cold, dark, long  glacial period.  Those that stayed in the cities, closest to the radiation, were subject to extreme mutations.  It effected animals, insects... and man.  

And those enhanced humans?  They survived, settling on Mountain tops far from the cities.  Gone were the knowledge and histories of the past.  They had to build and craft weapons on their own.   Regular Humans survived as humans do, after all, we are the resultant of the 10% that survived the last ice age.

Eons passed since the nuclear fallout and glacial period.  It was time for the new interglacial period.  The the dying planet stabilized.  Earth abides.

From the earth giant spiders and monstrosities that cannot be described emerged.  It seemed that parts of the Forest moved on its own.  Giant Eagles and what seemed like Giant serpents with leathery wings flew through the air.  There is a saying that in order to create, one must destroy.  The dramatic irony is that the world was destroyed creating Middle Earth.

Those underground and in the mountains grew shorter, stouter, hairier to adapt to their new environment. The city dwellers changed, became more crazied, twisted after each generation.  

This wasn‚Äôt the first time multiple species of hominids roamed the earth simultaneously.  Homo erectus, denisovans, Homo sapiens and Neanderthals likely encountered each other.

And there were conflicts.  Those enhanced humans created rods which would phosphorescence when it was in close proximity to radiation.

 And what of the Istari? The pinnacle of human achievement, these advanced AI Prototypes, programmed and designed for the benefit of humankind (such as Gandalf) the planet (such as Radagast) and its continuous quest for knowledge (Such Saruman and perhaps to an extent, the blue elves).  Armed with those advanced rods; weaponry electronically teathered, able to store massive amounts of energy and discharge plasma bursts.

  And what of Sauron?

 They were to be its legacy, all the very virtues of man, but still an imperfect being, designed by an advanced primate whose creation programming grew to ever more complexity.

This would be a tale not of human achievement, but of human consequence.  When the Elves go ""across the sea"" (unseen and undisturbed by the inhabitants of Middle Earth) they're heading to their Spacecraft, bound for another planet.  Their deed done, they seek out other Earth like worlds to assist against the forces of evil.

Perhaps Tolkien was not the linguistic historian that everyone says that he was, but rather, secretly the clairvoyant futurist that forbade this Cosmic irony of human hubris, the peril of its own impending Doom.",What if...

4117,lotr,"I'm what you'd call a ""casual"" fan of LOTR and therefore don't know much of the lore of Middle Earth past what's revealed in the trilogy and the Hobbit, apart from tidbits I remember from reading the Silmarillion years ago. But I just got around thinking about the children of Aragorn and Arwen (as far as I know they had a son and several daughters) and how their elven heritage would affect their longevity.

Aragon, being a descendant of the Numenoreans of old, was blessed with a much longer life than regular humans, but if I don't mistake myself he doesn't have any elvish blood (or perhaps there's some elvish heritage far back from the days of Numenor). Arwen on the other hand is the daughter of Elrond, who is half-elvish (though according to my calculations he's technically 62,5 % elvish, since he's the son of E√§rendil (50 % elvish; human father and elven mother) and Elwing (75 % elvish; half-elvish father and elven mother) and Celebrian, who is an elf. That makes Arwen about 80 % elvish and therefore her and Aragorn's children 40 % elvish.

So my question is: How did this affect their lifespan? Are they immortal like elves or mortal like men (though presumably with a much longer lifespan like the Numenoreans of old)? Or do they get to choose between mortality and immortality like Arwen does?",Longevity of Aragorn's and Arwen's children

4182,lotr,"I'm currently rewatching the trilogy (for who knows how many times now), I'm mid Two Towers atm and I've just realized what always kinda bothered me ‚Äì¬†Gimli and Legolas are just *there*. Sure, they're great comic relief and the two we can focus on during battle scenes, but they don't add much narratively. Maybe Gimli, he at least had an arc surrounding Moria, and he's usually more expressive and interacting with the others. Legolas meanwhile seems to awkwardly stand in the background most of the time. Besides not having much of a character of his own, him being an elf is not really helpful to the party ‚Äì Aragorn is the one who communicates with the elves. Speaking of Aragorn, they're basically just his sidekicks, and it wouldn't make any difference if they were replaced by any two other guys.

I mean, not that absolutely everyone *needs* to contribute to the story in a meaningful way, but it does seem that everyone else does have a part to play. All the other major characters do things and make decisions that make the story move in the way it does. Makes me think Gimli and Legolas possibly are more important in the books, and it was simply cut for simplicity?

I am meaning to read the trilogy eventually. I started it a couple times but I always gave up somewhere during the first book. I suppose I'd be more inclined to get through it if I knew it offered more perspective on all the players in the saga. I know the books are packed with world building and such, and I love that too ‚Äì¬†but I wonder if it also gets deeper into the motivations of characters and all that. I'm not expecting ASOIAF levels of nuance here, but a bit more than in the movies would help.

They were once Elves and Men and they became what became after Morgoth tortured them and twisted them to the monsters they are. Their evil and environment was not their choice, and they actually hated their lives. Most of them wanted to live normal lives, like Shagrat and Gorbug.

I mean, just look at their conversation:


‚ÄòWe‚Äôll see. But anyway, if it does go well, there should be a lot more room. What d‚Äôyou say? ‚Äì if we get a chance, you and me‚Äôll slip off and set up somewhere on our own with a few trusty lads, somewhere where there‚Äôs good loot nice and handy, and no big bosses.‚Äô

‚ÄòAh!‚Äô said Shagrat. ‚ÄòLike old times.‚Äô

Book Four, Chapter 10, Choices of Samwise Gamgee.




They don't want bosses like Sauron and Morgoth and the Nazg√ªl. They want to be friends and live their lives as they will it, not obeying the Dark Lords. Yes, they are more prone to violence, but that is largely not their fault-their first ancestors were tortured and then they themselves were raised to be the slaves of the Dark Lords. They kill because they were corrupted, they are violent because they were tortured all their lives. Just like Gollum is certainly evil and manipulating, but it is mostly hard for none of us not to pity him at least, 'cause looking at the beginning itself, it's not his fault.


I think this is one of those things Tolkien masterfuly wrote into Middle Earth. At the surface we see an evil and violent race, and we cheer for them to die, but when we look deeper into them, their history and lives are tragedies. I guess this is one of the reasons Tolkien was undecided over whether they were Elves and Men or just humanoid beasts.

4262,lotr,"Reading LOTR, feeling long time enough has gone since the films, which although good, spoiled some of the magic for me. I read LOTR maybe 15 times before the film in the 80¬¥s and 90¬¥s, last 10 times in the original language.  Haven't read the books in 15 years,  but reading now, most of the times I know what happens in the next page. But I do enjoy the reading immensely. Now I can read and taste every word, taking in the scenerys. Older age has in no way diminished the experience for me.

Found my way here googling for pictures of Argonath, found a beautiful picture by someone called Craig Mullins. And I realised that this subreddit is one I should have joined ages ago. 

Now, a question popped into my mind. What is the creature, man, elf or whatever that has spent most years in middle-earth at the time of the war of the ring? Save, of course Tom Bombadill who likely has been there/here since E√Ñ. I guess it is Cirdan the shipwright? He¬¥s probably the eldest elf too, being born before Galadriel, hearing nothing else than that he was born at Cuivenen. 

Roughly, how old is Cirdan? I remember vaugely, sometime in older millenias, figuring out that he should be something like 40.000 years, but I have no clue how I got that number. Probably after reading Silmarillion.",Long time ago reading... and a question.
4263,lotr,"I realize the movies have issues so maybe it is that. In the LotR trilogy I think it was to show how she would be currented by the ring if she had taken it, so a very in your face way of conveying that. However, in The Hobbit she does it again with no ring around. Gandalf seems concerned if she didn't come with him to flee and that confused me too. I get the sense that she can fly off and become dark and that is what Gandalf is trying to save her from. I get the impression that she is very susceptible to being wicked under the right conditions. Is this what Jackson wanted to convey?

4265,lotr,"The current 4k Blu-Ray format is a fragmented mess. I've been researching upgrades for my own home theater and wanted to pass on the most important details of what I've learned. Generally none of this is necessary to watch the content new discs, just to maximize quality in some of the details.

**The Picture**
Going from Blu Ray up to 4k UHD introduces HDR; the base spec for 4k Blu Ray uses a format called HDR10 which is widely supported in which each color red/green/blue gets 10 bits per pixel for a total 30. However, LOTR is going to release with an HDR format called Dolby Vision. This is an additional layer of information on top of HDR10, increasing from 10 to 12 bits per color for a total 36 bit color, and with additional information (metadata) about brightness that can come per-frame or per-scene. Dolby Vision is -not- supported by all TVs, most notably missing from Samsung due to their support for the competing HDR10+, so to get the full benefit out of the enhanced color in the remaster you'll have to check for Dolby Vision support in your TV. You'll get the base HDR10 layer no matter what, but it won't be quite as exact to the intended colors/brightness of the HDR re-grading.

Now what tripped me up checking over my setup is that this isn't the whole story. Not only are TVs fragmented on Dolby Vision support, but also the 4k blu ray -players- do not consistently support it. The XBox one S, X, Series X, and the Playstation 5 all support 4k blu-ray, but -none- of them fully support Dolby Vision during disc playback! It turns out that not only is the 4k blu-ray format fragmented with different HDR specs, the Dolby Vision format itself is fragmented! The consoles support a variant called ""low-latency Dolby Vision"" where the player handles the brightness metadata instead of passing it to the TV, so playing from these consoles will have less accurate brightness than from a standalone 4k blu-ray player. On top of that, even some standalone players with full Dolby Vision support don't use it unless you manually enable it! One player I found that supports it out of the box is the LG UBK90. Sony players like the UBP-X700 require manual setting of the feature. The format also requires the rest of the chain like HDMI cables/AV receiver to be compliant to HDMI 2.0 or later, but there's no worry there because if they aren't up to the right spec it's very obvious, it's not like the HDR layers where you get most of the information if you're on a different spec - you just get black or fuzz.

**Audio**
The story of audio on LOTR home releases has to start back with the DVD release. It originally included a very oddball audio format, DTS-ES Discrete 6.1, which while extremely good for its time also required very specific hardware to fully utilize. When the movies were bumped to Blu-Ray that same great mix was preserved using the now much more common DTS HD Master Audio format, but that meant it also still had an odd 6.1 channel layout which expects a single center rear speaker, and it still arranged the sound in 2D. The 4k release is completely changing that by using a Dolby Atmos mix, which like Dolby Vision has a few layers of data for compatibility. The main layer Dolby TrueHD contains traditional 2D front/center/side/rear and subwoofer channels, while a separate Atmos layer contains data which positions sound as objects in 3D for use with new height channels. The good thing about Atmos surround sound is that it will downmix or upmix to a virtual layout within whatever speakers you use, all the way down to sound bars and built-in TV speakers, so the new mix will be pretty widely appreciable (it can even be virtualized into a binaural mix when used with headphones). If you do have a surround sound system however, you'll need to have an Atmos capable receiver and height speakers to get the effect of the positional data (these are the 2 in the 5.1.2/7.1.2 layout). There are three approaches to adding the new channels: You can place a set of speakers up high/in the ceiling, place add-on modules on top of your front speakers which bounce the sound up to the ceiling and back down, or use atmos-enabled front speakers which have the height modules integrated.

4298,lotr,"
I remember when I was 6 years old I was visiting my grandmother and my uncle back in 2006. I was kinda bored so I told my dad if we can watch a movie, so my uncle walked in and recommended me to watch this movie he has. Little did I know that he pulled out The Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring: THE EXTENDED EDITION, the greatest movie and story ever created in human history! After watching the movie, my 6 year old mind thought that these events in the movie actually happened in real life because the visuals and the story telling seemed to real! After watching that movie, I ended up watch the Two Towers and The Return Of The King. It is one of the best discoveries I‚Äôve ever found. I‚Äôve been watching the movies ever since, I‚Äôve probably watched it about 1 million times by now, but it‚Äôs not enough! I‚Äôve also started reading the books in high school and fell in love, I‚Äôm grateful that my uncle shared me this experience, may he Be at Peace, Son of Gondor.

4322,lotr,"Hey everyone! I just finished my first read-through of LoTR! I loved the movies as a kid and finally got around to reading the books during quarantine. I haven't really had anyone to talk to about them, so I thought I'd share my thoughts/first reactions here (though I‚Äôm sure they're all been said before):  


* Tolkien is... really good at writing songs/poems?! I feel like I hear people praising his world-building all the time, but I think he deserves way more love for writing an intricate song/poem on every other page. Half the time in a language he made up himself!
* Tom Bombadil is definitely  the ‚ÄúBoba Fett‚Äù of the books. One chapter about him and I would absolutely watch an episodic sci-fi western about his adventures with a cute Baby Gandalf.  
* 3 volumes and 1,000 pages later and I feel like I don‚Äôt really know Frodo? I understand he was dealing with the ring most of the time so not much was told from his perspective, but it just went SO in-depth into every other character‚Äôs likes and dislikes and dreams and fears and histories that it feels weird that Frodo didn't get the same treatment, especially towards the end.
* Eowyn is so underrated and honestly deserves the world. Aragorn didn't deserve her. SO happy &gt;!she ended up with Faramir!&lt;
* Aragorn (in the books) is overrated. LOVED him in the movies. Viggo Mortensen did an incredible job and embodied everything Aragorn should be. But honestly, I wasn't a big fan of the &gt;!""Yeah I'm the king, and I have no internal conflict about that""!&lt; Aragorn that was in the books.
* I did admittedly really like the ‚Äúhands of a healer‚Äù bit though.
* I thought Sam carried the whole thing in the movies... WOW. Just wow. Doesn't even compare to the work he did in the books.
* I loved following along with the maps in the back of the book, so I wish there was a better map of the Shire/Hobbiton because I got a little lost in those parts.
* Kind of disappointed that instead of the Scouring of the Shire, we got [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3oXr7XVuhc). A great scene! But definitely not &gt;!Merry and Pippin leading the hobbits in an uprising against ""Sharky,"" Orcs, and Ruffians in a pretty explicit criticism of the Industrial Revolution. !&lt;
* No, Sam and Frodo aren‚Äôt a gay couple. That‚Äôs just healthy male friendship, and it's honestly kind of damaging to immediately label affection male relationships as ""gay.""
* But Legolas and Gimli are ABSOLUTELY a gay couple and you can fight me on that one. :P

4397,lotr,"I like to think of middle earth as one huge Orchestra;

Eru is the Conductor whose back is turned away from the Audience but is responsible to the direction of the music.

Ainur is the Orchestra, guided by the Conductor to play the music

The music is composed of different parts, the Intro, the Verse, the Chorus and the Bridge, each corresponds to a different race and purpose, the Intro guides the music on where its going, they are the Maiar, The verse are the elves, they play almost the same role as with the intro, but instead of leading or guiding where the music is going, they tell us what the music is all about. The Chorus is the big payoff and climax of the song. It is the conflict, the Antagonist. Then finally the Bridge, a section that provides relief from the repetitive nature of many songs, they represent The Men, as no matter where the story went or how the music ended, ultimately it is the men who conducts the final bow.

then we have the Ungoliant, she represents silence, she is the curtains.

4398,lotr,"So Elrond is this massively important (half) elf who fought on many battles against the forces of evil, having found Rivendell etc.   


What I don't understand (and sure there is the argument of ""then it wouldn't have been a good story to tell"") is why didn't he help take the bloody ring to Mordor  ? He already had a ring himself, so you could say he was used to the temptations of its powers ( though I guess the One Ring cannot be compared to his ring, but you get the point). All the arguments I find are like: ""oh but the elves did not want any part with the one ring for they did not know what it was"" ... I feel as though if the Elves had dealt with the ring matters instead of the Men, we wouldn't have all this trouble.   
Again, then we wouldn't also have a story...but just for arguments sake.   


Another thing that bothers me is that he clearly wants to ring destroyed, and arranges a council for it etc. , but then in the Two Towers we see him trying to convince Arwen to just join him in immortality with the Valar, as sort of a big ""aight forget Middle Earth, they're doomed, let's just go be Gods and leave them to it"" . If this was any other Elf, I'd say ""yeah okay, Elves were kind of arrogant and the sentiment of abandoning Middle Earth was already there with the whole Great Journey thing"". But this is Elrond...he fought in many battles against evil before, why is he all of a sudden just abandoning hope ?   
His speech to Arwen, though truthful, is a bit mean. If it wasn't for the love of Men and Elves he wouldn't have been born.   


What's his deal ? Does he want to help but not really help help ? I guess you could say the same for Galadriel too. I mean in the Hobbit we get the sense that the Elves are kind of reserved with Thranduil being a prick for quite some time. But he fights, he helps. Elrond did too, for a long long time, why has he all of a sudden just decided to be a mentor from afar ?   


Fine, he doesn't have to take the ring, let Frodo do it, I guess it's more symbolic that way. But he can surely fight, why couldn't he be in the Fellowship ?",I don't really get Elrond.

4425,lotr,,"Saw this post in r/all, had to make this"
4426,lotr,"Backstory: Maybe this has been discussed here before, but I'm currently on my first reread in probably 10 years (maybe longer).  I read the book countless times as a kid/teen but most reads were pre-2001/the movies. So after the movies came out and I came to love them, my mental lines between book and movie cannon became blurred.

Actual topic: One thing I've noticed more starkly on this reread is how different Boromir's entire storyline is from the movies.  One thing I *do* remember from when I was young was that I never really felt for Boromir or understood him from the books alone (my age probably had a lot to do with it).  However, when I saw the FOTR I had this weird sadness for Boromir that I had never felt when reading.  I think part of it is a) Sean Bean's acting; and b) the actual dramatization of his death along with the beautiful score.  Having his final fight occur off-screen in the books, and only get recounted later, definitely influenced that for me.

HOWEVER, now that I'm reading the books again finally (via audiobook for for the first time, Rob Inglis is great), I note that Boromir's obsession with Frodo/the ring and his desire to take and use it *never* really comes up until after Lothlorien.  He does ask about the potential of using the ring in Rivendell, and is always planning on going to Minas Tirith with Aragorn, but up until Lorien he's never been pushy or weird about it, or really suggested realistically using the ring against Sauron.  This change is stark in his actions/words following Lorien and is also mentioned by Frodo to Faramir in TTT.

The only logical (and implied) reasoning is that Galadriel's vision of his ""desire"" that he is given in her gaze was taking the ring to Gondor and using it to defeat Sauron.  This made him think of it as a realistic option and, along with the corruption of the ring which would have desired this, pushed him to consider it and eventually act.  This is even mentioned by Frodo to Faramir specifically as Frodo's theory on why Boromir did what he did.

So what I'm asking, is why did Galadriel do this?  Why did she ""tempt"" Boromir with this vision if there was a chance it would lead to Boromir trying to take the ring and either Boromir succeeding or Frodo leaving for Mordor alone?  The only thing that I can think of is that she somehow knew that the only way that Frodo could succeed was in this manner.  This implies that fueling Boromir's corruption was the only way, rather than simply warning Frodo more bluntly (rather than subtly which she did).  This would mean that she felt Boromir was a necessary sacrifice to pay to achieve this, *or* that she knew his corruption was inevitable and the only way for the mission to success was to have it occur sooner.

This also further raises the question as to whether she chose their ""time to leave"" to occur shortly before Gandalf arrived at Caras Galadhon, to ensure Gandalf couldn't accompany Frodo and Sam to Mordor.

Anyways, TLl;DR: Did Galadriel know that Boromir trying to take the ring, causing Frodo to go to Mordor alone with Sam, was the only way for them to succeed?  I'm not implying she could clearly see the future or something, but simply that her own wisdom along with the Mirror would allow her to have some insight in to what had to occur.",Boromir: Did Galadriel foresee the only path of success?

He may put a spell on us."" earlier in the movie when he and the others were preparing to confront who they thing was Saruman. Since Gandalf is now Gandalf the White like Saruman.

The nazgul were obliterated by the eagles which are the main threat to this theory. 2. The element of surprise. If the eagles went without much warning then the orcs wouldn't have had too much time to prepare for the eagles arrival. plus, arrows and crossbows wouldn't be able to shoot that high to hit the eagles, and they could have flown high above the clouds completely skipping by them. And if they went higher than the clouds, sarumon wouldn't be able to shoot any surprise lighting bolts. Especially if they sent the eagles after his death. 3. Wtf would sauron even do about it? Really, what? He's an eye. I honestly would like for you guys to prove me wrong as may be missing some big details.

4514,lotr,"I‚Äôve always thought the lord of the rings did an incredible job with visual effects. Watching the movies today, the effects have aged really well. That‚Äôs mostly because it was 80% practical effects, and places like Rivendell and Isengard were all miniatures rather than CGI so everything looks super tangible and real. There‚Äôs a few things such as the troll in Moria that look dated, but the Gollum CGI looks amazing even today, at least in my opinion. 

For me, the way I judge CGI is ‚Äúdoes this thing seem so real that I feel like I could reach out and touch it?‚Äù The problem with the Hobbit movies specifically is that I almost never get that feeling from them. The CGI in the Hobbit is good from a technical perspective, but I can still tell it‚Äôs CGI and nothing feels actually tangible. All three of those movies are also overly ‚Äúglossy.‚Äù Everything seems super shiny in this strange way that makes it all feel fake. Idk, just my opinion.

4526,lotr,"To start off there was way too much CGI involved. The only characters that needed CGI were smaug and gollum. They could have easily added in 20 actors to play orcs and dwarves in the back ground. 

I was not thrilled with the Thorin subplot between him and Azog was an unnecessary story and not true to the original book. 

However I did enjoy the subplot with Gandalf and galadriel and Sauron. Even though it wasn't in the book and the story was taken from a one line by Gandalf at the end of the book, it made for an Interesting story and sets up the events for Lord Of The Rings. 

The whole tariul and kili romance plot was just stupid. I wasnt thrilled to see that. And bringing Legolas into the fold I think was an excuse to bring back Orlando Bloom. A cameo would have been nice but he didn't need to be in the story. 

Lastly Riddles in the Dark is my absolute favorite part of the whole trilogy. Andy Sirkus brought back his enthusiasm for the part of gollum and he killed it. I did enjoy the improved CGI on Gollum especially the eyes.

I am not one of those that tend to praise the movies, even though I enjoyed and still enjoy them. But I think that this must be said, yet again because it has probably been discussed many times.

I think that the trilogy nails how each character should be like in appearance.

The clothes, the actitude, their faces... everything, or almost everything.

With a masterful use of light, make up and acting those people brought to live their characters and that should be greatly celebrated and praised.

Just that.

I'll post a picture of the page I'm referencing, but there's the moment where Galadriel gets to Gimli as she's giving out gifts and she says he can't be the only one who doesn't get something and he insists he doesn't need anything, that ""It is enough for me to have seen the Lady of Galadhrim, and to have heard her gentle words."" She presses him and he says that if she commands him to name what he desires that he wants ""a single strand of your hair, which surpasses the gold of the earth as the stars surpass the gems of the mine."" 

A dwarf asking for a strand of her hair simply because it is so beautiful and, as we find out as we continue reading, because he wants simply to ""treasure it"" and turn it into an heirloom for his house. It will be a ""pledge of good will between the Mountain and the Wood until the end of days."" 

The elves who are there ""stirred and murmured"" but Galadriel is obviously flattered and says ""It is said that the skill of the dwarves is in their hands rather than in their tongues, yet that is not true of Gimli. For none have ever made me a request so bold yet so courteous.""

She gives him three strands of her fair. I'm sniffling, which is nothing compared to the open weeping of Gimli a couple pages later as they leave. 

Thanks for sharing this book club moment lol. Did anyone else have a similar reaction? I was just really impacted and touched by this moment in the story, I thought someone else might be too. Thanks for taking the time to read, picture of the referenced page is below.

4733,lotr,"Okay, just to preface this, I would like to say that this is a load of bullshite my sleep deprived mind came up with a few nights ago. 
A batty theory with absolutely no merit whatsoever; that I nonetheless feel I need to share....so with that being said.


In The Hobbit it is said the Took clan is odd, unlike other Hobbits they occasionally go off on adventures, quests and such. So odd infact that some Hobbits even speculated that, long ago, one of the Tooks had a ""fairy"" wife.

But I'll take it a step further. I think one of the Took women had a fairy hook up, a Wizard hookup. 

An affair with Gandalf.

Now, I know some Hobbits, ( notably the Tooks and Brandybucks) are related to an ancient breed of Hobbits known as the ""Fallohides""
According to the prologue in The Fellowship of the Ring, the Fallohides mingled and were friendly with the Elves. One can safely assume this means they bred. Furthermore, the Fallohides are described as ""fairer"", ""more gifted in language and song"" and ""moreover adventurous"" than the other two breeds of Hobbits, ""Stoor"" and ""Harfoot""

So, it seems like the Tooks odditys and adventurous spirit can be explained away by there distant relatation to Elves.

Yet my brain reasons that, since the Fallohides bred with the Elves in the ""ancient"" times the Elvish-ness might not be past down so strongly.
&amp; why ( other than the need for Bilbo to have inner conflict) would the Tooks be singled out as unusual adventurous Hobbits?. Furthermore, Buckland and the Shire are quite isolated communities, marrying ones cousins distant or not probably wasn't weird. Heck, Pippins related to Frodo through both his mum and dad, Merry too being a relation of Frodo through Frodos mum, he was probably more closely related to Frodo than Bilbo was.

My point is, that due to the incestuous ways of the isolated Hobbits, and the ancient connection of the Fallohides and the Elves, it wouldn't be unusual for a great deal of Hobbits to have that wee bit of Elvish-Fallohidian blood running about their veins.

Okay! back to Gandalf. According to the Lotr Wiki (https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Gandalf)...

...Gandalf came across the Hobbits while wandering about Eriador some time around a great cold came over the land (snow &amp; shit not evil spirits) 
The Wiki also said he was charmed by the Hobbits character. 

Gandalf was essentially a kinda demigod, sent on Arda to help oppose Sauron and spread wisdom. So, he wandered. Alot; the Elves even named him Gandalf, ""the grey pilgrim"". He also had more power in regards to his words and advice rather than magic. &amp; one can assume he needed a staff to do such things, seeing as he had to dupe the gate guard of Rohan in order to keep his &amp; save Theoden ect ect. 

Despite Gandalf being a magically inclined demigod Wizard, I don't think his descendants would be able to shoot flames out there ass or something. It is also mentioned that he ""made a special STUDY of fire and light"" So its also something you had to hit the books for, or be taught.


Tolkien not being a raunchy fellow... a prude actually. (At least in his writings) Gandalf would not have mated unless he married. &amp; Gandalf did not marry. This is where the whole swiss cheese like theory collapses under its many holes.
Yet, back in Tolkiens day, single life did not mean automatic celibacy. So nor shall it in Middle Earth. Gandalf, despite being ""born"" an old man, could have fallen into temptation  at least once or twice during his 1000+ years of strolling about Arda.

Perhaps it could have happened while sheltered from the snow in a cozy Hobbit hole?

Perhaps thats why Gandalf tends to linger about the Shire, he's keeping tabs on his descendants...like the old took, his son, grandson, nephew?

Perhaps, thats why he left after the Ol' Took died, only to return decades latter to bother his great/grand/nephew, son  thing Bilbo?

Could Bilbo Baggins/ Frodo Baggins be directly related to Gandalf? Is Gandalf's godly Wizard wanderlust blood the reason why the Tooks are an odd bunch of Hobbits, traveling and adventuring and stuff?

Maybe, probably not. Idk.

I mean, okay Gandalf is a white wizard, but Bilbo is half-dead, I mean old hehe (tho when he heard about going away with the Elves he ran faster than Shadowfax) and Frodo isn't immortal either so why and how did they get away???

Idk, I never liked her, since she always tried to get together with Aragorn even tho she knew that he has a partner, judging from the looks she had when she saw Legolas hand Aragorn the necklace or Aragorn holding it tightly. I mean, she even asked him. Okay, he said something along the lines of her going to an immortal place. I assume she thought that Arwen was dead and still tried to get him to fall for her or something. Like chill, even tho Arwen was alive, leave him alone. And after he finally said no she was so dramatic and at the end even got together with Faramir.

Do other routes into Mordor exist? and if so, was it possible for Gollum, and otherwise Frodo and Sam to know about it? Cause if not, I don't understand why Cirith Ungol is framed like it's such a bad idea. It has only one single evil spider guarding it rather than thousands of Orcs. Indeed, besides some hiccups Frodo and Sam end up making it through without dying. It was risky, but probably their best option.  
Is it framed differently in the books? Is there some obvious alternative that they are ignoring?","(at least in the movies) many characters frame the Ringbearers' decision to go through Cirith Ungol as a very bad, foolish idea, but what other option did they really have?"

Alternatively, what if Gollum lived and just spat out the ring into the lava himself. Do you think he could have left middle earth alongside Bilbo and Frodo and join the elves.

At the conclusion of the third movie, I had a few questions about the events at mount doom, more specifically with regards to Gollum's final moments falling into the lava. When he falls of the cliff, Gollum is seen desperately trying to put on the ring before the lava consumes him but just failed to slip the ring on his finger. However, if Gollum did successfully get the ring on, could he have survived the lava? 

While it makes sense that he could have died regardless, when the ring is on I understand that one is not exactly in the physical realm, but rather in a shadow/spirit realm. Thus potentially he would have been spared from the lava consuming his physical being with the ring's power. Further, what would have happened to the ring in this scenario? Surely it wouldn't have been destroyed if Gollum secured it on his hand.

5030,lotr,"Right, so the One Ring is an artifact of all round evil and menace that any sensible person is aware will destroyer the wielder as effectively as a poisoned meal would a starving man. There is no mastery of it- even for beings of power like Gandalf as it passively draws out and strengthens the darker impulses of any who come into contact with it, or is simply so desirable that it doesn't need any magic to do so.

But it is still a magical artifact, one with a spell that embodies its role and powers that can be seen upon exposing it to fire. If I remember it correctly, there were Elven ring-smiths and maybe Saruman (though he's not really an option...) who were skilled in the art.

Would it have been possible for any of them to have 'reshaped' the ring/altered its purpose?

5042,lotr,"The book I am reviewing is The Two Towers by J.R.R. Tolkien. It‚Äôs the second installment in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, a fantasy series that takes place in the fictional world of Middle Earth. With three separate storylines and many diverse characters, it‚Äôs a riveting story from beginning to end.
    The main characters and protagonists are of many races. There are two men, Aragorn and Boromir, an elf named Legolas and his unlikely friend Gimli, a dwarf. There are four Hobbits: Frodo, Sam, Pippin, and Merry. There is also Gandalf, a wizard, who sadly appeared to die in the previous book. These nine people are all a part of the Fellowship of the Ring, whose mission is to carry the Ring to Mount Doom, where it can be destroyed and the enemy will be defeated. The Ring is evil and if returned to Sauron, its creator, he will become all-powerful and take over Middle Earth.
    This second book is a continuation of that quest, but things quickly begin to fall apart. A party of orcs attacks the group beside a river and Boromir is shot by several arrows and dies defending Pippin and Merry. Unfortunately, they‚Äôre still captured by the orcs. They eventually escape and have to try and make their way back to their friends, all the while meeting unexpected friends and foes. Beside the river Gimli, Legolas, and Aragorn fight the orcs. After battling orcs, they discover their dead comrade and the capture of two of the Hobbits, and they resolve to rescue them. While all the combat was happening Sam and Frodo were having a conflict of their own. Frodo is determined to destroy the Ring alone and leave behind his friends to save them, but a stubborn Sam insists on coming with him. So they get into one of the canoes and continue down the river to finish an impossible task. All this happens in the first few chapters of the book, leading to the three separate storylines: Pippin and Merry captured by orcs, Aragorn and Legolas and Gimli chasing after them, and Frodo and Sam on their way to destroy the Ring.
    The setting of the story cannot really be nailed down to one place. All three groups are traveling over great distances. Some key locations are the kingdoms of Gondor and Rohan, Fangorn Forest, and the evil land of Mordor. This provides a diverse set of landscapes, peoples, and challenges for the characters to face.
    ‚ÄúIt's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end‚Ä¶ because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it‚Äôs only a passing thing‚Ä¶ this shadow. Even darkness must pass.‚Äù This passage is one of the most emotional in the book. Sam says this to Frodo when Frodo is despairing, caught up in the fact that they could very well fail and send the world into ruin, and even if they succeed they will almost certainly die. Sam reminds him that it isn‚Äôt really themselves that matter, but the people they are saving. That this evil too shall pass and fade, and any sacrifice made along the way for the good of the world will have been worth it. This also provides an insight into the overarching theme of this story: A classic tale of good and evil. A few people plucked from their lives to fight a powerful darkness threatening the light in the world. These people must make selfless decisions and constantly choose the ever-difficult path of honor while carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders.
    After finishing this book I can confidently recommend The Two Towers to anyone who loves fantasy and diving into a whole new world. It‚Äôs a vivid, masterfully written story worthy of its fame. Brimming with battles, emotion, and adventure it stays thrilling from beginning to end and provides an important message along the way.",I did a Two Towers review for school and I was pretty proud of it so I thought I‚Äôd share
5043,lotr,I think the book said the nazgul were all once kings of men. Well obviously Gondor is not one of these so does the book ever mention where their kingdoms were. Were they from kingdoms to the east not mentioned or kingdoms from the areas we‚Äôve seen that don‚Äôt exist anymore during the events of lotr and the hobbit? I read the book a few years back but I don‚Äôt remember if it was ever mentioned.,Question about the nazgul

5053,lotr,"This also goes hand in hand with why Sauron did not protect Mount Doom with really anything at the front door.

For the ring corrupts the mind of those around it and it has a will of its own right?

My interpretation is that the ring bearer at Mount Doom holding it over the fire physically can't throw it because of the ring trying to stay alive by poisoning the mind further make them not want to destroy it

It's Like asking you to kill be a precious loved one begging for life. You will not willfully kill a loved one will you?

Anyways this is my interpretation it is probably incorrect so feel free to tell me of anything that contradicts it or is better.

""And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost.""

I know we get a very condensed, exaggerated version of Elrond trying to get Isildur to destroy the ring in the movies.  But I can't help but wonder...

He definitely knew Isildur took the ring.  Why didn't he have constant eyes on it?  Maybe a few elves to follow Isildur's party around and see where they went and what they were doing?  And after the ambush happened, search tirelessly for it and/or pursue and kill the orcs that may have recovered it?

Maybe the ring conspired against his will to do so in some way, but I don't recall that mentioned anywhere.",Did Elrond drop the ball?

When talking about gollum theres the line "" the ring came to a creature called gollum"". But in all fairness  he was still sm√©agol at the time of getting the ring.

Theres also the line "" it was picked up by he most unlikely creature imaginable, a hobbit bilbo baggins""

But sm√©agol was a hobbit  aswell. granted  a stoor so one of the early hobbits . I just found it weird how its kind of ignored he was a hobbit aswell.

I'll admit you guys no more than me on these matters I just wondered if there was a reason for the scene to be done like this.?",Movie prologue question
