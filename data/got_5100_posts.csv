 The scenes,The characters, The plots are just sensational.Not only that but it gives a realistic view on life and teaches you things.Like how being a man of word and honour ends for Ned, The politics behind every move from Baelish and Varys,The sacrifices one has to make for living like Arya.

What i most like is how every character has a specific goal and duty to fulfill.From cersei's desire for power to Jon's life for the night watch.No one should compare  their journeys as they are all unique and important to the show.

Easily the best show i have ever watched and will go out with having an amazing time watching this show.",[No spoilers] Game of thrones is breathtaking

42,gameofthrones,"So I'm sure someone may have said this before, but I'm wondering if perhaps all of our expectations and desires for the story to go a certain way we're subverted because GRRM wanted the show to end completely differently than his books. Maybe not to tank the show but just change it and that probably threw a wrench in their plans? Like it would kind of take the fire out of the books if the show did exactly what they would do. Not nearly as many people would read them then. Knowing the true ending is different could be very intriguing.

51,gameofthrones,"There have been many video games based of Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire, whether they be RPG's, or strategy games, or whatever Telltale was trying to do. Most of them are not really that good if i'm being honest, which is a real shame because I think the world of both Westeros &amp; Essos would make for an incredible video game. &amp; there are two ways they could do it.

One a Third/First person role playing game where you play as a Mercenary or Sellsword in Westeros, maybe swear allegiance to one of the big houses &amp; possibly work your way up in the ladder as you go on a quest of revenge, with there being a Morality system, having to train with your sword &amp; armor A La Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Maybe building your own house &amp; getting married, &amp; of course getting to interact with some of the characters of GOT, maybe incorporate some elements from the books as well. The other way they could do it is a Civilization/Total War style strategy game where you play as one of the main major houses (or your own house you can build from the ground up) and make peace with and/or conquer areas of Westeros until the Long Night begins, or maybe there can be a mode where you already are king or queen of the Seven Kingdoms &amp; prove you can rule until the day the others come.

&amp; before you say ""They already did stuff like this"" I mean ACTUALLY good, if you know what I'm saying. Because yes, they did try stuff like this already, but none of it was good. Yes Granted a proper good Video Game is unlikely to happen now, due to the others being bad &amp; also the last season probably damaging the reputation of the series, but still, a good Game of Thrones game would just be amazingly amazing.",[NO SPOILERS] Game of Thrones Video Game.

Now I have not finished the books or the tv series.  Although I heard it ended terribly which I was bummed about because its a great show and story.  I was thinking about the ending and I was thinking how would people have taken it if everyone ended up being killed.  The combatants fighting for the throne did not “win” the throne.  If it were to end with the throne sitting empty and the cities destroyed would fans have liked that more?  It would be a twist of events (maybe, again, I haven’t finished the series). Just my two cents on it, although I’d like to hear your opinions on the ending.  ***Please do not try to include spoilers of the end if you can***",[NO SPOILERS]. The ending of game of thrones

67,gameofthrones,"What is west of Westeros?

Hello dear friends and fellow roleplayers. My name is Athanas and I am a 21 year old male from Europe. I  have roleplayed for 7 years now and I believe that I can call myself a highly skilled roleplayer and am looking to find that in my roleplay partner. 

I've recently finished watching Game of Thrones for the second time and through both my first watch and my second watch I have grown to like and love Arya Stark of Winterfell. Which is what inspired me to get this roleplay idea. ""What is west of Westeros?"" She said in the final episode. Well, why don't we help each other find out? The plot I'd like to do would have Arya boarded on the ship of someone who despised all of the noble ladies and noble men, yet agreed to let Arya Stark on his ship because they both had the same question on their minds. 

Here is where both of our creative minds work together. West of Westeors can be anything we want it to be. Possibilities are endless. Maybe there is nothing and maybe there is unexplored land. Maybe there are more armies and soldiers, civilisations and cultures nobody ever even heard about, not even the Maesters at the Citadel. 

My character would be an Ironborn who was never, not even once on the Iron Islands, since his father betrayed his kind by working with the Lannister army. His father fled and brought his pregnant wife and his best men on board. But when his father passed away,  my character was named the captain of the Ironborn who will never be welcome in their own land. He meets Arya when he was sailing west of King's landing and when he heard what her intention was he took her onboard to explore the west together.

If this intrigues you feel free to message me. I prefer to use Discord for roleplaying. I hope to get a raven from you soon.

69,gameofthrones,Okay so a thought popped into my head today which was how can Daenerys afford her beautiful white gown then I thought about it how can Daenerys afford anything period. Because all the food and gold she got from sacking cities couldn't have lasted 6 seasons. Now I guess Highgarden brought her food for her arrival in Dragonstone but then Highgarden fell and so she had to convince Jon to help so it can be assumed that Highgarden gave her so much food that it lasted till Jon joined her and I guess gave her the Norths food but what gets me is Meereen. How did she get food in Meereen? How did she afford clothes in Meereen? I know she got 10% from the slaves but that was a long time after she sacked the cities so where did the money come from before then?

136,gameofthrones,"Going in for my 2nd rewatch with much more maturity, I realized that Ned Stark was pretty much overrated in this show. 
Ik that us fans loved him &amp; were very sad when he died. But really? It’s nice that he even pulled a full season before getting himself killed. 

My problem with his character is that:

1) He was very at playing the game of Thrones (as did all Starks tbh, except maybe Arya &amp; Sansa when they grew up). He was just very predictable &amp;
all-honorable.

2) He was very confrontational &amp; didn’t know when to pick his fights/enemies. He should’ve worked in silence &amp; paid more attention to what his enemies were planning for him.

3) Dumb decisions: so he was faced with Jon Snow’s secret &amp; the best thing he could come up with is to say that he is his bastard? Can’t he even at least tell his wife about it &amp; keep it between them? Or leave the secret with someone to tell it to Jon Snow?

All That said tho, I believe he was a necessary character in the show because he demonstrates how having such qualities like trust &amp; honor won’t help in reaching power and there will come times where you need to make necessary actions that are morally wrong just for the greater good. 
Simply, he showed us that the nice guys don’t always win. In fact, they have the least chance in winning.

I wish they would have kept rickon off screen and as soon as she’s crowned he pulls a Euron from the show and claims the position as lord of winterfell. Him being killed along with shaggy dog was done to get him off the minds of book fans so he wouldn’t show up and do what I said! Like I said men of the north who jon Saved and led them in battle many times wouldn’t just let their king go to the wall so easily just to put a woman in his place I don’t buy it for one second! Hell gendry had a legitimate claim to the throne after being legitimized by dany fuck the last three seasons were written so half assed with the vision of the third Star Wars trilogy its puke worthy and I stop watching every time after Jon is stabbed just like the books!,[SPOILERS] The North

188,gameofthrones,"I’ve just finished Game of thrones and I loved every single season (yes, even season 8). It has consumed my life for the past 2 months and I’ve been dreading this day would come for so long. The story, the characters, the lore, everything about this show I love and I am extremely sad to see it end.

I kinda feel a bit empty and am reluctant to start a new show cos I just feel like nothing would compare. Does the feeling go away?😂

I’ll be starting the books in a few days which I’m beyond excited to start reading (and I’m not even a book reader!).

I think I’m going to watch the show again alongside the books this time to see all the changes and similarities. Then I’ll probably be re-watching it for the rest of my life lmao.

I might watch the ‘Last Watch’ documentary tonight, I’d love to see anyone else’s opinions if they’ve managed to check it out yet.

So it’s goodbye to watching thrones for the first time but I’m here to stay in this community, and delve deeper into all forms of thrones! :)",[NO SPOILERS] Finished the show after 2 whole months...

the sketches were hand-drawn and offline cartographies and what I did was join the pieces and add missing things. I have also added color (looks sloppy because I'm not that good at it, sorry) .therefore, this map is not cannon but maybe in the future we will see something similar.

Now since the show is almost the show ended a year ago and literally everyone on the internet was lowkey spoiling it for everyone who didn’t have access to it (i.e. me) I know I’ve seen Jon Snow be talked about or mentioned in the later seasons. So I feel as though that’s why I hadn’t shed as many tears as I did during “The Red Wedding” scene. I’m confused and just on the edge of my seat thinking of how the hell is he gonna come back? Please no spoilers in the comments. I feel as thought I’ve spoiled enough for myself already 😅. Still upset they killed my boy though.

She referred to them as foreign animals. In which place might Westeros be located then?

285,gameofthrones,"I know this is a pretty hot take but I’d love to see everyone else’s opinions on it, both the good and the bad. I’ll start of with some of my favourite bits in the episode:

-I thought Varys’ death was pretty fitting for his character. He did everything for the good of the realm and die how he lived. A pretty satisfying end personally.

-Throwing Missendei’s chains in the fire was a fitting touch and I loved the shared hatred both Dany and Grey Worm have for Cersei, contributing to the turn later in the episode.

-That final scene between Tyrion and Jaime was one of the most emotional in the show. Seeing a reverse from the ending of season 4 was nice to see and Tyrion breaking down was heartbreaking.

-Dany torching the fleet and the golden company was pretty epic I’ve got to admit. Showing off the true power of Drogon was hella satisfying.

-I adored everything with Arya and The Hound. So many cool shots contrasting their relationship in season 4 and when she finally calls him “Sandor” was the cherry on top and a perfect ending for their arc.

-Then... CLEGANEBOWL. It was everything I dreamed of an a perfect ending for the hound. His main goal in life was to kill his brother and I felt like this was well fulfilled, with an epic shot of them falling out of the red keep into the flames.

-Dante turn was pretty unexpected and questionable, but I’ll get to that in a sec. Clarke did a great job of portraying her twist and seeing Drogon incinerating  the city and it’s inhabitants was INCREDIBLE.

-All the ground combat with the armies was also one of my favourite parts of the episode. I’m a sucker from pretty violent combat and this was one of the best yet. Seeing the armies clash and the slaughter of civilians was hard to watch. 

-Also, Jon helplessly trying to stop his men and saving who he could was a great character decision, and the shock on his face was amazingly played.

-Now, maybe my favourite sections of this episode was everything with Arya. She chose life instead of vengeance and it was perfect. Seeing her blood covered face trying to save anyone she could was everything I wanted from one of my favourite characters (one of the only ones left). It was a perfect moment of her whole character arc imo.

-The final scene with Arya and the horse was one of my fav moments too. With its symbolism and the shot of her leaving the city, wowee.

-The fight which I had been waiting for between Jaime and Euron happened and I loved every minute of it. I’ve never seen a character more happy to die in got, with being able to ‘kill the kingslayer’. Overall his character was pretty underwhelming but this was a good send off.

-That final scene between Cersei and Jaime was beautiful. One of the most emotional scenes in the shows history which was played masterfully.

The Questionable stuff:

-With Jaime being my favourite character since the very start, I’m pretty conflicted on how his story ends. He was seeming to have a great redemption arc which was reverted by the end. A part of me adores it and am happy with his final scene being (as Jaime said to Bron) ‘in the hands of the woman he loves’ in the form of Cersei. Everything he has done has revolved around Cersei and seeing how he tried to escape that he couldn’t stay away in the end. I’d love to hear anyone else’s opinions on this.

-So Dany’s turn. I kinda had it spoiled before I started the show a couple of months ago so I’ve been trying to look out for foreshadowing for all 8 seasons. It was all pretty sudden and definitely needed to be fleshed out more... but, I think everything which came from it was extremely well done. The special effects, the score, the shots, the look on all the characters faces. So I might be able to overlook it, I’ll have to give it time to think about.

Sorry that was quite long but there’s so much to talk about lmao. This is a pretty unpopular opinion from what I’ve heard so I’d love to hear everyone else’s perspectives on the episode and anything which I may have missed :)

Personally, I got to give my favourite to Tyrion’s trial and then the trial by battle. His speech is astoundingly well written, and you can almost feel the emotion. The battle though... oh my god the battle is amazing. It ramps up the tension all the way throughout, until the climax where, let’s be honest, we all thought the viper was going to win. After watching the scene in the show, it was... fine I guess. I don’t quite know why they had to change what the mountain says at the end, and why they didn’t include the mountain casually killing that random stable boy, but the fight itself was good. Anyway, what were your favourites?","[SPOILERS] So I just finished all the books, and wanted to hear some of your opinions for the best scene."

353,gameofthrones,"I wasn't happy with the ending (just like every person I have ever talked to about the show) but I can't help but to think about the storyline after the show ended. How is Bran the Broken accepted by the people? Are there any major wars in his lifetime and are there any political coups trying to oust the new leader, maybe someone still loyal to Dany and the Targaryans or even some of the Lannister loyalist. Maybe assassination attempts?

Also I would love to see what happens beyond the wall with Jon/Aegon. I can't think they just go beyond the wall and he grows old and dies, there are so many adventures and the unknown beyond the wall it could have countless storylines. 

Another great storyline would be Bravos in general. I found the Many Face God and the Golden Company so fascinating, I wish we could have explored those areas more. All in all I am just missing the show and excited for the new show, just really miss the original and wish we could get some content to hold us over.",[Spoilers] I still want to see what happens after the show ended
354,gameofthrones,"So ive just finished 7 and LF died and i honestly have mixed feeling about this.I mean you cant really like him for how he manipulated characters and always had an ulterior motive to his decisions but he did kill joffrey and save sansa(x2) and jon.

But he brought alot of complexity and his character added alot to the show.The varys vs baelish scenes were one of my favourites from the whole show and i wish i got to see more of it.

But it was because of him that the whole 'chronicles of wars' started and to think how a person as lowborn as him could start something like that is extraordinary.

I want to know what the general consensus is about LF so do comment.",[Spoilers] Littlefinger

387,gameofthrones,Season 8 was just disappointing but this was definitely the best part of S8. Watching everyone you love come together again at winterfell was so awesome from a fans POV. It was nice they took the whole episode and just showed all the relationships that have been built up and how everyone came together to fight the only fight that matters. It’s also bittersweet knowing that most likely a lot of characters you love will die in the following episodes and you cherish the last moments you may have with them. I loved it was a nice slow episode and we get to see so much wholesome and heartwarming content that the rest of the show doesn’t always have. Unfortunately the next episode was disappointing and as was the rest of the season but I will always love S8E2 and the rest of GOT.,[SPOILERS] S8E2 was one of my favorite episodes of all time.

403,gameofthrones,"Holy shittt! in terms of importance to storyline and characters, id say this has got to be the best finale ever.Like all of westeros(cersei that bitch) reuniting and the WW entering the North really puts the future of westeros in perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

The meeting of the rulers in the dragonpit has got to be one of my most favourite scenes of GOT.Almost everyone had either a friend or enemy at the other end.But what i dont understand is how cersei could forget the father to her child and the love of her life to force him to go away

But LF death is the one i have  mixed feelings about.I mean you cant like him but the things he brings is surely going to get missed.He gives so much complexity to the show which is really beyond any other NonMajor(?) Character.

But the cherry of the cake was the Targaryen reveal.I mean i was just in awe.Not only abot Jon but about rhaegar.I dont understand why didnot lyanna just come out and say she loved him?

It’s a shame because they introduced him in a badass way, yet nothing really happened much with him apart from saving and sleeping with Daenerys. The way that he was written off is also bad. Didn’t even get a real GOT death. He could’ve joined Daenerys on the journey to King’s Landing and be another wildcard character on the mix with Jorah or Jon.

455,gameofthrones,"Hey people. just learnt something about Game of Thrones which totally changes how I view the series.

Apparently even though it's presented to us with the characters speaking English, they are most likely not actually speaking English but rather ""the common tongue"" as they call it, of whatever intelligent civilisation is being shown. They are most likely speaking some ancient language that doesn't even exist in our world. Also, the ""people' may not really be humans as we know them, but rather a similar intelligent species.

According to George R R Martin, it's set on a different planet to Earth which is similar but actually slightly larger than Earth, and with different history, geography etc.

The same logic applies to Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin), which shares many similarities with Game of Thrones. They are presented as speaking Japanese for the main audience to understand, but canonically, they could be speaking any language.",[NO SPOILERS] Mindblown

473,gameofthrones,[removed],And there I knew- that Season 8 was no place for me. This was where I had to depart.
474,gameofthrones,"After all the negative coverage of the S8 finale I shied away from season 8 for a long time because I really didn't want to be disappointed...until now. (Lockdown).

Am I the only one that thought it rounded off OK?

Yeah, I was gutted when Daenerys burnt King's Landing to the ground, but for that to be necessary to set up a proto-democracy in Westeros was a fair trade off of sorts?

Arya became the badass we wanted her to, Ser Mormont got the death he desired, (all?) old scores were settled, favourite characters made it to the end, even the bit with Brienne updating Jaime's entry in the book of the kingsguard felt like closure.

Stark kids all ended up where they truly belonged...

Even Ser bloody Podrick! Good for him!

Yeah, Daenerys could have won it all nicely and been the people's queen, but how predictable/boring would that have been, really?

Maybe I just think fairytale endings are overrated?

Or maybe I'm the one seeing the fairytale ending and others would have preferred more decapitation and nudity, in keeping with the earlier seasons?

Anyway, first time poster looking to be inundated with phone buzzes. Dracarys!",[SPOILERS] Am I the only one??

647,gameofthrones,"After having been a fan of both the show and the books for years, something literally just popped into my head. Cersei is almost always referred to as Cersei Lannister and not Cersei Baratheon. Is this mentioned anywhere? I was thinking about the fact that she is a widow and that maybe Westerosi widows go back to their maiden names, but even before Robert’s death, people spoke of her as Cersei Lannister. Catelyn Stark doesn’t go back to being Catelyn Tully after Eddard’s death. She is always formally referred to as Catelyn Stark unless they’re literally talking about the fact that’s she’s originally of House Tully.

736,gameofthrones,[removed],[ SPOILERS ] Season 8 question
737,gameofthrones,"Hi friends!

I’ve been watching the series for over a year now, and finally finished yesterday! I watched the first 6 seasons about a year ago and loved it SO much that I decided not to finish it (I didn’t want it to end lol), and subconsciously put off finishing it until this year when I started a rewatch of the entire series again.

Once I got to season 7 (since I hadn’t seen 7 or 8) I was anxiously awaiting the shows downfall since everybody says that season 8 is horrible and ruins the entire series. But the further I got into season 7, and then the further I got into season 8, that downfall just.... never came for me?

I thoroughly enjoyed season 8, and felt that even though Dany’s “mad queen” transformation was absolutely devastating, it was written well and it made sense to me. Her obsession with the iron throne was apparent from the beginning and I never really understood why she wanted to be Queen in the first place. She didn’t need the title to accomplish what she accomplished, she just wanted it because it was hers.

I definitely think that the rest of the episode AFTER her death, starting with the time skip to Tyrion and Jons “trial”, was disappointing. THAT’S where I can understand everyone’s argument about the show ending too quickly. Everything happened with too much ease, like the unsullied just LEAVING after Dany died, everyone just choosing and accepting Bran as king, etc. I think they needed just one or two more episodes for that to be wrapped up naturally.

But in all honesty, season 8 as a whole and all of the events leading up to it made sense to me. I thought it was fantastic. Even IF it’s the worst season of the entire show, it’s still the worst season of one of the best TV shows ever made.

I’m so sad it’s over! But I’m happy that I can talk about it with others now, so if you disagree with me (I imagine many people do) let me know why! I’d love to discuss it!

I guess it’s onto the books now (:",[SPOILERS] Why does everyone hate the entirety of season 8 so much?

776,gameofthrones,"1. How did Jon get his hands on hair Gel in Prison? Ok that was a cheap one. 
2. How did Dany not get slightly suspicious that Jon may try to kill her in her 'Mad Queen' state? I mean he is the main threat to her throne after all.
3. The Night king was built up as an almost God like threat for 7 seasons ..... ANNNNNND hes gone..... took 1 hour to kill him. I mean it was harder to kill Ramsey ! Cmon ! 
4. Hold on.... Why is Jon going to do in the Knights watch now? Wasn't the whole point of the Knights watch to defend from the the threat of White Walkers..  who are now all dead.
5. And why did Jon need to listen to Grey Worm who's heading away anyway?... Arent Bran and Sansa now in charge...? He also happens to be the actual heir to the throne.
6. Also on the topic of Bran, why was everyone so happy to vote him in as King, to most people he's just a crazy kid who has weird visions..... In fact some of them had never even met him before.
7. Why should they even believe in Bran, when Sansa (his own sister) clearly didn't and forced independence. 
8. I mean, Yara would definitely be the sort of person who would have wanted independence. 
9. Back to Jon, why did no-one mention he was Aegon Targaran once during his 'trial'? I mean what was the actual point of anyone finding out about that?

10.Also why didnt Drogon kill Jon for killing Dany? 
11. On the topic of dragons. How did Rheagel not see Eurons ships at all before he was shot dead . I mean there was a lot of ships FGS!!
12. Why did nobody mention the fallen Starks once all season? Ned did not die for this!
13. Bronn as Master of coin? Excuse me? Expect a hit on the Westeros economy..
14. Back to Bran, he was unable to be Lord of Winterfell a few seasons back because he was 'no longer bran' . soooo who's that on the throne? Three Eyed Raven? Who knows...
15. Im sure all the Dothraki died at the start of 'The battle of Winterfell', So why are they showing up all over the final seasons. Did they forget they died? Did you die though?!!!!!
16. They didn't actually tell us what happened with Drogon. WHERE DID HE GO ?
17. Going back to the Night King, WTF did he even want ? Particularly with Bran ? Guess we will never ever know.
18. How were the Unsullied supposed to start their own house. None of them can have kids right? 
19. How was it even possible for Dany to get so bloodthirsty in less than an episode. 
20. We will never find out what Arya finds West of Westeros.

21. Hodor died for what exactly? (RIP HODOR)
22. Because there seemed to be no point of need for the Three Eyed Raven.
23. What was the meaning of the Night Kings Symbols?
23. Why didnt Arya use any of her faces in the last two seasons? 
24. Jamie's redemption story ruined as he ends up going back? Makes no sense really does it?
25. What was Bran doing during the Battle of Winterfell? Did he even warg into anyone or any animal? 
26. In Fact, What was point of him learning to warg in the first place.
27. How was Jamie able to kill the Mad King without punishment? Yet Jon has to go to the Nights watch. Not Fair!
28. Varys died spreading the news about Jon's true parentage. Then it is never mentioned again??
29. What was the point of the white horse and Arya?
30. Where are Jon and Tormund going at the end?
31. Why did the Night King king want to kill Bran?

792,gameofthrones,"I haven't been in this sub more than a couple times, but I've loved A Song of Ice and Fire for almost as long as it's been out.  I read the books, and then again, and then years later watched the entire HBO series.  I've since read Fire and Blood.

Is it just me, or is Jamie Lannister's character arc not under appreciated?  I think with all the celebrity of ""Game of Thrones"" as it is, for example, the playful ""Which main character is going to die next?"", Jamie's path from evil bully to wanting only true love and kindness is so beautifully tragic.

And with everything he goes through on the way.  Body and soul, he is brought down, laid low, crushed and crushed again.  He crawls his way up and becomes a much stronger man.  And again, both in body and soul.  He's more patient, more mindful, and yet still fervent and passionate about the things that matter most to him.  And he is still a man of action.

In the end, despite banding together with others -- even previous enemies -- in order to do what is right by all people and not just himself, and even trying to love someone new, he cannot help but to return to the only one he's ever truly loved.

This is where he fucks up, because instead of them becoming instantly loyal to him, they retain their minds and loyalty. Then there’s a few more seasons of Jon and his crew and his army of the dead fighting the night kings army of the dead, all the while Cersei sits on the throne. Finally, once the night king falls to Jon’s army, then comes the internal conflict. Bring on the longest night the world has ever seen, or let Cersei Lannister rule on the iron throne for the rest of her days.

I originally posted this a year ago. It was removed, not sure why. Throwing it out there again to get some feedback.

My idea is for a spin-off that begins in the events that took place in Episode 3, The Long Night. It'd be possible to work in a reason why Arya was able to jump and stab the Night King so easily without being noticed by any walkers in the first place.

From Bran's perspective, when Arya is hidden and ready to jump to kill the Night King, Bran can see that Arya is about to jump and a mental battle between the Night King and Bran ensues, in which Bran attempts to warg into the Night King. Time outside of that mental battle is passing but we the viewers are taken into this ""Professor X vs Magneto"" sort of mental battle. The battle goes into the past and deeper clues about the Night King and past history of Westeros is given (whatever would feed a plot to make a history about the past interesting). Bran's attempt is somewhat successful in that he stops the Night King for split second in the present and with that, his entire army is in this sort of a limbo state because he's focusing on fighting Bran and not controlling them. That is when Arya (she doesn't even have to know) makes the jump to kill the Night King, however, he's still powerful enough to break out and grab her. Bran makes another attempt and into the fray they go again. Bran, freezing the Night King a second time for another split second, allows Arya to stab him exactly as it happens in episode 3. This all happens seamlessly.

In their heads, those split seconds take an entire episode or possibly more as the events could tell an entirely new story from the then warged into NK.

In these ""mental battles"" since they are linked, the Night King uses Bran's power to take them into the past and it's a past that Bran can't entirely focus on not influencing because he's fighting to keep the Night King busy. This whole journey has unintended consequences and ""corrupts"" the past, like Hodor. So the plot could either be that Bran accidentally changes the future or it could be that Bran has to choose a ""less bad"" future, out of the mess they make in the past they were. After the battle, Bran would be ""marked"" once again and maybe cursed. Because Bran was also warged into, the Night King takes them to the very moment the Children of the Forest were transforming himself into the Night King, attempting to trap Bran in instead, to become the Night King instead of himself. After that it'd be unclear who wins this, but in the present Arya kills the Night King and ""Bran"" emerges (Then the last episode of season 8 happens). Since Bran was ""warged in"" and the Night King had taken him into the past, he too was in the ritual when the Children stabbed the NK's heart, it could be worked in that Bran gets to see both timelines, his and the NK's.

After the NK is dead Bran starts losing control in the present and reaches a weakened state. He then asks to be taken into the closest Weirwood tree, which is in Winterfell, in order not to die or because he's afraid of becoming a Night King himself. So he becomes part of the tree, rooted in like the last Three-Eyed Raven before him, the power of the old gods preventing him from dying and accidentally also ensuring there will always be a Stark in Winterfell in the future. This would reveal that he who now is the Three-Eyed raven was also the first one to see it all because both of their consciousness were linked up during the very moment the NK was being turned and also when he's killed. Since Bran is in both Places at the same time essentially Bran now sees everything the Night King saw throughout the span of thousands of years he lasted. Making present Bran stuck in this weird loop that, he isn't the Night King, but he knows exactly what happens, he literally knows the future from having seen through the NK's eyes in the past and through his span of existence, as if the NK were sort of a raven.

This is my theorie that may prove the legitimacy of Aegon VI.

The Targaryen's connection to the number three is the main thing this is based on(the next chapter is going to be about the connections to the number) 

The proofs:

The first case of this is their Sigil(the Dragon with 3 heads)

And there are numerus example:
The first being Aegon and his 2 sisters 
And after the Dance this became more prominent
Rhegar Dany and Viserys are a trio
Rhegar's three sons were a trio
And after the death of Rhegar, Aerys, Rhaella and Rhegar's children Dany Viserys and an old aemon were the trio
After the death of Viserys Jon(most probably Aegon VII) became the third head
And finally the point to prove Aegon VI after the death of Aemon came Aegon VI.
And also one of the most important thing being the 3 dragons all three dragons will need riders and you can only ride a Dragon if you have The blood of old Valyria (meaning only descendants of the dragon lords can ride dragons). 

A lot of you may say that these have no connection. But the wizard that is GRRM wouldnt make this many Targaryens as trios if it didn't mean anything.
Plus why else would he add another unknown daughter to Rhegar that is barelly even talked about. You could say that he did It to make the Azor Ahai prophecy come true bc both he and maester Aemon claim that the dragon has three heads meaning Azor Ahai will have two companions and Aemon says that if he was younger then he could be one of the 3 heads. And this in my opinion Points to the fact that the 2 companions can be any Targaryen. And this can come true with the two trueborn sons of Rhegar and his Sister instead of the unnamed daughter he had. 

So as wierd as this sounds i actually think this could be the truth",[Spoilers] The 3 heads theorie

916,gameofthrones,"Hi! For my school project I’m going to make comics about how to stop the Knight King. The way of stopping him will be different in each comic and it’ll just be a funny and unrealistic way.

For example:
Arya shooting the dagger with a catapult from miles away.

I’m looking for ideas for the following characters: Danearys, Jon, Arya, Tyrion &amp; Bran.

So my whole family has watched game of thrones and were swearing by it as well as how good it was. That was until the trash seasons came out and they suddenly stopped. I watched season one and I liked it a lot. I just never got around to watching the rest. Everyone knows of how game of thrones was shit towards the ending. Nowadays, my family never talks about GOT unless it has something to do with how bad it got. It makes me think that they wasted their time watching all of it and were just disappointed.

1182,gameofthrones,"I've seen a lot of different ideas and interpretations on this scene. A lot of people say that her walking away was taking the ultimate vengeance, since her wounds were so atrocious he would suffer the most until he dies. I'm talking about the show only since I havent read the books. However, when Arya walked away, I personally took this action to mean that Arya thought there might be a chance the hound would live, but she also wanted him to suffer. I didn't think she wanted the hound to die for a few reasons. One would be the way they bonded a couple scenes or eps before the Brienne fight, and Arya offering to sew up his wound and learning about his brother. In the scene when she walks away, Arya also offers the hound some water. And Arya sees through his provocations to get her to kill him. I think Arya still resented him and wanted him to suffer but couldnt bring herself to kill him. I also think this is true because at the house of black and white, the waif asks Arya if the hound was still on the list, and she says yes, and the waif sensed that it was a lie, he had been taken off the list before Arya left him (she didn;t know if he would live or die). What do you all think about this scene and why? What are your interpretations?",[SPOILERS] Arya and the Hound - Why did she walk away?
1183,gameofthrones,"George is very clear about how many years lass during ASOIAF. B1 begins in 298 AC, B5 ends in 300 AC. Which means that, since S6 picks up where S5 ended, and that S5's finale depicts B5's ending, S6 happens in 300.

So bases on the books, there is only 2 years that pass between Ned's departure to King's Landing and Castle Black's mutiny.

Why does the series says 1 season represent one year when George clearly says two years pass between A Game If Thrones and A Dance With Dragons ?
Was this just to justify Arya having sex in S8 (which we can assume happens in 301) so at 12 years old really ? (since she's 9 both in the series and the books)",[SPOILERS] Years passed

1185,gameofthrones,"As we all know this great show has six seasons, so I will be watching until season 6, as usual, for my third rewatch. I am currently on season 2 and this time around I am experiencing all the characters differently. I believe with all these shows and books self-interpretation is the main take-away, and this time around I have found the following:

1. Ned Stark was so stuck-up with his honour, he became blinded. This has been clear from the start. However, this time it really started getting on my nerves how stupid he was. Littlefinger even told him never to trust him, look at what he did. I also believe even though he tried to be a good man, he is a tad bit of an overrated character.

2. I loved Tyrion's character from the start. For some reason, however, I had it in my thick head that he was fair and just toward Cercei (god knows why, but I did). I must have not been paying attention because damn, this man can be sassy. The contrast to who he is now and his character in the non-canon seasons of 7 and 8 has also struck me hard this time, really hard.

3. Daenerys, at times, really just expected everyting to fall into her lap. Don't get me wrong, I love her character, but it's always so many other people that suffer for her and she does not seem te give too much regard to secure the safety of other people who decide to follow her, she just plunders forth and hope everything works out. Nethertheless, I still love her character (starting the books soon, and it'll be interesting to see how her character there and in the show contrast eachother).

Lastly I would like to ask the book readers a serious question. I am someone who likes to read, if something grabs my attention, be it the story, characters or writing style. How quickly did A Song of Ice and Fire grab your full attention? Is the writing style compelling, is it more focused on plot (like say Rowling's writing) or on description (Tolkien is my example here, he fleshes out lengthy descriptions for basically everything).

Thank you all in advance. I would also like to point out that the views I shared is but my own experience and I do not force these views onto anyone.",[SPOILERS] With my 3rd rewatch I am once again experiencing everything differently

Tywinn knew how to play the game of thrones, cersie did not, constantly making risky, extreme emotionaly driven decisions that almost always work against her in the end. 

Tywinn also actually wanted to mentor Tommen to be a good king, as we can see when he is already giving him advice on jeoffreys death bed

TLDR: tywinn as hand with his ruthless yet wise decision making would perfectly compliment and mentor tommens kind and gentle personality, making them a perfect combination to rule the 7 kingdoms",[Spoilers] Tommen and Tywinn would have been the best king/hand combo to rule the 7 kingdoms

1246,gameofthrones," I've always admired how G.r.r martin has layered mysteries and has so many-layered plots in the background we don't really read about. But G.r.r Martin does something which I think even Rowling does, he makes his mysteries fair, giving all the pieces to the audiences.

But when I was thinking about it, going back in my head and trying to remember how it's done, in the books. I couldn't piece it together. So I was wondering how does he do this? How does Martin weave in clues and tells the audience about conspiracies and mysteries?",[No spoilers] How does he write mysteries so well?
1247,gameofthrones,"I've been thinking a lot about the saying ""Winter is Coming"" and how it has 4 different meanings, one referencing the coming of the King in the North once more, another meaning the inevitable end of Summer, another meaning that no matter how content you are or happy you are right now, dark days lie ahead and you must be ready to endure the ""winter"", and the final being a literal reference to the Long Night and the White Walkers coming once more.

Was there any strategy George R R Martin used to create these mottos/words or was it just ""whatever sounded cool""?

Also, what would your house motto be, either in Westeros or the real world?

I really like the quote ""We all get the same amount of ice. The rich get it in the summer. The poor get it in the winter."", *Bat Masterson.*

My words would probably be ""Ours of Winter, Theirs of Summer""",[No Spoilers] I really love the house mottos George R R Martin created and was wondering how exactly he came up with them?

Everybody knows the more common ideas of who wrote the letter.

But from the clues given i think i have found a new possibility.
The clues suggest it was written by somebody who knows Ramsays style of writing. And a maester who has been with the boltons for at least a little time would know that. And luckily for us there is a maester who was for a short 
While and his name is Qyburn. Yes, i think he could have wrote it for a few reasons :
1. He knows Ramsay's style.
2. Bc it wasn t written by Ramsay it was a different color then the two other letters.
3. As he is now with the Lannisters who are fighting the starks it would benefit them if Jon died. 
4. It was only signed by ""Ramsay Bolton Trueborn Lord of Winterfell"" bc Qyburn didn't know who were his allies.

I finished GOT in 2 months (in quarantine) and have not read the books.. although the end may be “boring” or “disappointing” as some of my friends feel, I feel like at the end Bran represents the divine truth.. and that truth will always prevail.. of course we want a “hero” or someone who has “earned it” but I actually think this ending is justified bc of that..?

1444,gameofthrones,"A few days ago I made a post saying how I did not like the beginnings of season 6 of GOT. Well the show did what I thought it couldnt because after watching E9 it has become one of my favorite seasons. Its not just that episode though. While I didn't like the Bran or Arya storylines at the beginning I came to really enjoy them as they progressed. I have heard from some that the show hits a hard decline at Season 7 and then an even harder one at Season 8. Is this warranted? I can't see how they could mess this up too awfully bad. I have also heard some people claim that the series is better if you dont watch S7 and S8 at all. I do not plan on doing this but I would like to hear some opinions on if the show really does get worse.

Regardless, I am looking forward to S7 and S8.

1492,gameofthrones,"After finishing the show 2 days ago, I’ve now entered the second to last review. This one revolves around the penultimate episode, in which Dany goes a little crazy in kings landing. This episode has been highly criticised, but how does it actually hold up in my opinion? Let’s start with:

The filmmaking:
Pros: Even though the story in this episode can be criticised a lot, I don’t think that the filmmaking can be in the same way, in fact I’d go so far to say that this episode is brilliant! From some great shots, fitting music and even brilliant editing(my favourite being the cutting between Arya and the Hound. We’ll talk about this later), this episode really looks and feels the way it should. Daenerys massacre of kings landing is extremely well done. You can really feel the scale of death and destruction that she brings. Everything feels as horrid as it should be, with tonnes of grit, blood and slaughter. If I’d only rate the episode from this angle, it’d be a solid max score. However as you all now there is more to an episode then just the filmmaking which brings us to:

Story: 
Pros: Before we start talking about what went wrong, I want to begin with what I really liked. One of these things is the Hound. This is a character that unfortunately has been in a sort of limbo for a while, not really doing much except just being a tool for funny lines(with the exception of some great conversations in these last episodes, as well holding the funeral in season 7). In fact I wrote in my s8e3 review that I thought they should’ve killed him there and then. Now I’m not so sure. I think that the way he went out and how they paralleled this to Arya was brilliant(though I think they should’ve had a bit more buildup for Aryas choice here). Ending his arc with needlessly dying with the man he has hated for his entire life was a great send off to this sometimes polarising character.

This might be controversial but I sort of liked Cersei’s end. Maybe it was because of Lena Headeys acting, which really shined as Cersei slowly realises that she’s loosing badly. I especially loved when she met Jamie, embracing him as even though she had lost it all, he was still there for her. I think there is a tragedy to Cersei Lannister, and for her to die in the arms of the one she actually loved, away from the politics and life that had shaped her worst sides was overall an acceptable way for her to end. Just my opinion here though, and I know that many will disagree. 

I also quite liked Tyrions role in the episode(also controversial). While I do agree that he should’ve seen the madness coming a while ago(like a certain other character did), I do like that they show him desperately clinging on to the idea that Dany is truly good both in person and as a queen. Even going so far as to betray his closest friend out of his share belief in Dany, which of course turns out to be one of his biggest mistakes in the entire show. I feel like for Tyrion, this is the woman he put his trust in. When he was at his worst, his faith in her as a leader was one of the most important reasons for actually somewhat recovering again, so I can believe that he’d cling onto her until the end. Basically he knew what she really was, but he just didn’t have it in him to accept it. Again I think that Peter Dinklages acting is one of the reasons why I put this as a positive. You can really read all his struggles from a single facial expression in this episode. Oh well now to the bad stuff.

Cons:
Oh dear. For now I’m going to ignore the elephant in the room and move on to a smaller issue. Jamie Lannister and as a bonus, Euron Greyjoy. I’ve already said in a previous review that I don’t like the way they effectively ruin his character arc, and while I have seen some good counterpoints(for example that abused people often return to their abusers) I still think that his entire story throughout the seasons just feels... pointless after these final episodes. His fight with Euron is just odd to me as well. Sometimes it feels like they’ll have Euron do the dumbest shit just because “Euron quirky haha”, and this episode is no exception. Why on earth would Euron a) sneak back towards Kings landing b) fight Jamie for no reason after just escaping death. It feels like the writers wanted Jamie to have a symbolical fight over Cersei(against a man who plowed her), but it just didn’t work at all. 

The entire golden company thing lasted for like 10 seconds so I honestly don’t even know why they included it. Had the season been longer we might’ve actually gotten to know the company, which would’ve made their role bigger and more impactful overall, but here it’s just filler. The captain of the company for example was only in like 2 scenes in the entire season...

Varys death is badly executed(no pun intended) but there is one complaint I don’t agree with. I 100% agree that telling Jon(in the open mind you) is extremely out of character and stupid for the character to do, but I think that him telling Tyrion straight up does make some sense. To Varys, Tyrion is the only one he can trust. He’s the only one he’s close to, and(imi) someone he also believes has the realms best interests at hand. Combine this with the fact that Varys has seen the doubts in Tyrion’s eyes, makes it not impossible for me to believe that he’d actually trust Tyrion. Of course one could try to give the writers credit by saying that “the most secretive man died because he was honest”, but I think that’s giving them too much credit.

Grey worm following Danearys orders sucks to see as a viewer, but the unsullieds unquestioned loyalty to her has always been a plot point, so as much as it hurts to say this, I can believe that he did what he did. There is also the matter of Misandei, as her death also completely fucked with him. Having been programmed to become an emotional wall, only to fall in love and for that love to die would fuck with him. He can’t handle the emotion that comes with such and event, and just snaps. 

Now to talk about the elephant that is charging towards me faster then you can say genocide. Dear god how this they mess up Dany this bad. To me it’s not the idea that’s bad, in fact I think that they’ve slowly built towards Danys turning for a long time now. Notice the word I used there, SLOWLY. Because of the length(or lack there of) in these last 2 seasons, I think that they couldn’t manage to properly end her arc in an convincing way. In 3 episodes she’s has more negative(as in the type of character arc, not an opinion of it) development then in like 2,5 seasons. This results in her massacre just feeling extremely out of nowhere, and just makes it frustrating to watch. Because she’s such a major character in the show(and the focus of the episode) her actions really sour the entire thing overall. 

So while the massacre is well made, it’s really hard to care about some of it when the attack itself doesn’t make any god damn sense. 

So what are my thoughts overall? There are some good moments and character progressions, but in general the episode loses you after dropping the ball so hard, it falls straight through the earth.",[SPOILERS] Thoughs on the bells/battle of kings landing

1613,gameofthrones,"Danny’s life was traumatizing and was the product of incest which can cause serious mental health disorders.

It’s already common for “Normal” people to make very irrational decisions because they get emotionally overwhelmed so imagine if you add a traumatizing life on to that and being the product of incest which can cause all sorts of mental health disorders. 

Her situation didn’t help either. Everyone was looking up to her to basically “save the world.” That can put a lot of stress on someone. Even light amounts of stress can cause irrational decisions making. 

She could’ve also been under the influence of alcohol. All that stress can make someone crave alcohol as a form of coping.

PTSD is another thing that she could very well have and something that can cause irrational behavior.

Now what happens if you gave that person the power to effectively act on their feelings?",[Spoilers] Has anyone every considered Danny’s mental health factoring into why she made the decisions she did during the final season?

1622,gameofthrones,"Just finished watching the TV series and liked it. I remember when it originally aired there was a lot of controversy over the final season or two, which has me wondering if that's because the books were that much different. 

I know the books are always generally better, but my question is are they that much better that it's worth the significant time investment in reading them versus reading an entirely different series now that I've seen the general storyline in its entirety. 

Looking for answers solely from those who went TV--&gt;Book, as I already know 100% of you who went in reverse would say to read them (I would too)

1624,gameofthrones,"10 minutes ago I just finished Season 5 and it ended in the most horrific way possible. After Robb’s death, the motivation i had for watching the show grow smaller. I was invested in the good guys, as many of you are. This show pushes me through 10 episodes of hell and then ends with the good guy dead and little punishment for the terrible humans. Sorry, started ranting there. Anyway, after I saw Jon get stabbed by his own Nights brothers, as I was watching it happen I told myself “that’s it, fuck this show I hate this shit I’m done.” Not long after I went on YouTube and searched up a video for his death, to rewatch it cause I love to torture myself (I did the same for Robb). I then proceeded to see that he was resurrected 2 EPISODES LATER AND THAT HE KILLS DANERYS AND BURNS THE IRON THRONE? I have not seen the scenes for these events yet but at this point knowing that it does happen, is it worth it to keep watching? I feel like I just accidentally showed myself the climax and that there really isn’t anything to look forward to. I have been contemplating just watching those clips and then putting the show to rest for good. What should I do?",[SPOILERS] The show has just been ruined for me.

1740,gameofthrones,"Could someone please explain the purpose of the story surrounding this character? Does this god/demon/magic have more relevance in the books? 

Apart from the three eyed raven and a few other sources of magic (Warlocks, Worgs etc.) it’s one of the only things we know ACTUALLY is magic. 

Like what actually is it? 

Why did it become irrelevant later on in the series? 

Did GRRM have bigger plans for it later on? I mean several entire storylines revolve around it, and I know that Stannis’ death and the demise of several priests/worshippers in the Brotherhood kind of brought it to an end, but with how powerful it is, why did it become forgotten about?",[Spoilers] The Lord of Light

1816,gameofthrones,"When the equivalent of our modern age comes to Westeros, how do you think they would feel about Cersei Lannister? Here's what would probably happen in my opinion:

'She's just a woman living in a man's world'

'All the awful things said about her must've been just rumors because her family is hated and she's a woman'

'Cersei's children are probably Robert's. It was just a nasty rumor to disparage her. Genetically speaking, if Robert had recessive blonde gene…'

'That incest story with her and Jaime is most likely another rumor started by Ned Stark or Stannis Baratheon because they hate Cersei.'

'There's no evidence suggesting she blew up the Great Sept of Baelor and Margaery and Loras and…'

'It's not Cersei's fault! It's Tywin's bad parenting, Joanna's and her children's death and Robert's domestic abuse that shaped her into what she is. Sure, a horrible past doesn't excuse being a horrible excuse for a human being, but she's a female historical figure. She has a pass.'

""They only hate Cersei because she's an intelligent and ambitious woman! Sure, both of those are not redeeming qualities, and ambition is the most obvious and the easiest reason why anyone would do terrible acts, but she's a woman. WOMEN IN HISTORY ARE ALWAYS VICTIMS'",[Spoilers] I can already see it

1829,gameofthrones,"After the mixed bag that was the long night, I’ve now ventured into the only three episodes rated lower then 7/10 on IMDb. But are these episodes as bad as they say, or are there things to appreciate here?

We begin with episode 4, The last of the Starks(don’t get the title at all, but that’s another question in it’s entirety).

Filmmaking:
Pros: The episode is(as usual) shot well or at least acceptably so. However the episode is lacking more interesting shots, with only the ending scene outside kings landing really being of any note. This includes shots of Tyrion walking towards the gate, and the long distance shot of Missandei getting beheaded(we’ll get there, don’t worry). 

Music has some good moments like(big chocker) in the end, in which I think the score really gave gravity to the scene. Otherwise it’s generally just ok, with no other scenes that I thought were improved by the music. 

Cons: Generally nothing much here actually. Nothing really bad, even though a lot of it is just standard shots. The only time I really didn’t like the music here was in the scene in which Sansa tells Tyrion about Jon’s parentage. It was the standard stark theme, but it felt very out of place in that moment. There is one big negative in the filmmaking, but it’s only bad in conjunction with the story, which brings us to,

The story: 
Pros: The start of the episode, while not the most eventful isn’t particularly bad either. It’s mostly centred around the “party scene” in which the characters celebrate the previous battle. These scenes are generally fine, but I do think they dragged a bit. In here we get some good scenes which includes Gendry becoming a lord, a nice conversation between the hound and Sansa as well as a drinking game between some characters(we’ll get there). The funeral at the start was also a good way to get things going. Final thing I really liked here was Varys, as he naturally changed his view on Dany(again, we’ll get there) in accordance with what the show has already established about him.

Cons: Now let’s get into the(rotten) meat of the episode. Brons choice here seemed extremely out of character, because not only did he seemingly completely turn on the Lannister brothers because of greed(which I’d argue is in his character, but I don’t think he’d fuck them over just like that) but also being seemingly spiteful towards them, like when the hell did this happen... Just a season prior they seemed to be on good terms.

Speaking of the Lannisters, I’m very disappointed of what they did to Jamie. Him finally leaving Cersei and getting with Brianne was incredible development for him, that has now been squandered because he seemingly relapsed into his Cersei addiction... I generally believe that this narrative choice makes his journey in the show a lot worse overall...

Dany in this episode is practically what happens when you take all of her worst character traits, and put it into a single episode. We got them all, arrogance, anger and ruthlessness. The problem for me isn’t that they show these sides of her, in fact I think that Danys negative character arc has been built to for a long time now. I just feel like the switch happened to fast. 

I get that her longing for the throne(something almost mythical that she grew up thinking was her families right) was completely shattered with Jon snows right to the throne as well as Jorahs death fucked with her, but it sometimes seems like most of her good character traits are completely missing. For example when she speaks with Jon, her love for him(which is genuine) seem to be absent in favour of her just trying to manipulate him into not telling other people about his secret(which is fine on it’s own, but I feel it’s just kinda weird that she just seems to be manipulating him, with no love in sight). Again in some ways I like what they did with her here, but she does seem a bit... off. Of course big man Jon tells them anyway, which I’d honestly be more surprised if he didn’t do.

Now let’s talk about my biggest issue with this episode, the death of Rheagal. Everything about this scene rubbed me the wrong way. Like I said before, the filmmaking in the episode caused a huge issue in the plot. This is because there is no way that Euron could’ve shot down the dragon from the angle we’re being shown him coming from. We’re shown that his fleet emerges from behind the cliffs, and this means that by all logic, he either must’ve shot the dragon through the rocks or straight in front of him, in which there is no way that no one should’ve spotted him. If we see where they emerge from the cliffs, I’d almost argue that it’s most likely the former. I base this on how we’re presented to his fleet in the scene(being revealed from behind the cliffs, as in that they weren’t in front of the dragons at all). 

The episode ends with another main character death, and I’m sort of ok with how she(Missandei) dies. It isn’t the best death by any means, but not awful either. 

This was my(maybe messy) thoughts on this episode, an episode with a promising begging that just turned sour as it progressed. Tomorrow I’ll watch the penultimate episode, in which the battle of kings landing probably takes place.",[SPOILERS] Thoughts on the last of the Starks

1842,gameofthrones,"Ok hear me out, I know most will say Dany, Tyrion, Arya or Cersei(or Hot Pie) but I think Jamie has everything needed. If you disagree please Tell me Who your favourite character is and why.

Character Development✅: This one is perhaps the key factor. Jamie has by far the best development on GoT. He is a prick in Season 1 and we see him evolve into an honourable man, we understand why he killed his King, we see him deal with the loss of his hand and become more and more indepentent and less of a man of Cersei, we feel more sympathy towards him every episode and he ultimately makes a choice to leave Cersei to fight for the living, completing his Journey and earning redemption

Heroism✅: Jamie is one of the most heroic characters in GoT. Beggining with his Journey with Brienne he starts showing that he is Really a man of honour and a good person. He saves Brienne, Tyrion, does his best to save Myrcella, tries to help Cersei to make the right choices and fights at the battle of Winterfell with the North even though he commits treason doing so.

Acting✅: Prime example is his bath with Brienne. Nikolaj is an amazing actor. 

Humanity✅: This is Also a Very important thing. He isnt a perfect man. He has his flaws as does everyone in Real life but he tries to overcome them on his way to redemption.

Emotional potential✅: Again his bath with Brienne is Very emotional, and even his death scene is, mainly Thanks to Nikolaj’s acting. He always loves Cersei, even though he knows what she is like and he cares about Tyrion, trying to save him multiple times, when Tywin and Cersei despise him and want him dead.

Overall I think he is the best character, I just wish 8x05 didn’t fuck up his entire journey and he killed Cersei in the end Jon-Dany style, giving his life to Do so. (Also that rape scene was quite unneccesary😒)",[Spoilers] The best Game of Thrones character in my opinion: Jamie Lannister

1854,gameofthrones,"Here are 3 kinda dumb questions I haven’t been able to find much about online, wondering if anyone could help me. 

1. About Ned bringing Jon home to the North: Ok so when Ned came home with a baby he claimed was his to winterfell he obviously had to have a wet nurse with him and word would have spread through out the castle, and wintertown, and eventually through the north about Jon’s existence. My question is how do you think the common people, servants, stewards, minor lords, etc. reacted to that? Is there precident for other Lords of winterfell, warden of the north, king in the north, etc. having bastards? Northern Culture is really different than the south and the only Northern Lord I can think of with a Bastard is Rose but he’s obviously evil af. Like how “judged” was Ned when he strolled through the castle gate with lil bb jon jon? 

2. Speaking of Roose Bolton, he’s definitely a hypochondriac right? Maybe that’s why he was so quick to legitimize Ramsay( in show obv) even though Roose clearly recognizes Ramsay is a terror. 

3. Ok I got lazy and didn’t really look this one up but is there any sort of theory out there that talks about the parallels and mirroring of like robb/jon/theon/and ramsay. i’m not smart but i feel like there’s some sort of robb=archetype and like theon being the anti robb and jon is the bastard robb and ramsay is the bastard theon so ramsay is the anti jon.

1924,gameofthrones,"After getting season 8 as a Christmas present, I finally started the final season. Of course I was aware of the seasons infamy, so I was a bit worried about my coming experience.

To my pleasant surprise, the first two episodes weren’t that bad at all. Sure the writing did seem off at certain points, and not a lot happened, but I can appreciate having two episodes like this as buildup before the battle. I especially liked episode 2, with it’s great character interactions and some stand out scenes(Brienne becoming a knight was my favourite).

Now we get to episode 3, which isn’t just the longest episode so far, but also something the show has built to for a long time. I have many thoughts, some good and some more negative. I’ll list them off in different categories.

Filmmaking:
Pros: In general I really liked the way it was shot and directed. Lots of varied scenes and shots from big battlefields to smaller stealth sections. The music was unbelievably good as well in my opinion. Effects were on part as expected.
Cons: The editing during the battle scenes are a double edged sword for me. In one way the very quick and shaky editing was a brilliant way to show the horror and chaos of the battle, but it also made the experience unwatchable at times, since it was hard to even see what was going on in many scenes. This was worsened with the low light, clouds and whatever else they came up with. The scene in which the 3 dragons battle was undoubtedly the worst, as I legit couldn’t see what the hell was going on.

Story/plot:
Cons: Let’s start with cons since many people don’t like the episode. The Dothraki scene was both idiotic and horrifying at the same time. Liked the way they showed the horrors of the undead, but the entire strategy was brain dead. Also found it extremely weird that Dany didn’t burn the dead that stood by the barricade. Had she torched all of them, then they would’ve gained some extra time to regroup. 

Most important characters had insane plot armour, especially Jon snow. This unfortunately removed some tension from the episode as no character seemed to be able to die. Almost every single important side character present died in battle, but only 3 main ones died, and all of those 3 had largely fulfilled their arcs. We’ll get to these later though. The only side character death I thought was weird is Lyanna Mormont, who died in such a fanservicy way. As for characters I think should’ve died, I 100% think that grey worm(because of his conversation with Melisandei), the hound(been a long time coming) as well as maybe some others  should’ve kicked the bucket. I think that Melisandres death should’ve happened with the hounds, as they would’ve died protecting Arya when she ran to the night king. Basically fulfilling the hounds arc while Melisandre goes out in a fitting way for her character. Though tbf I did like how she died, as this also fit her. 

The death of the night king was very underwhelming, but in the same way I don’t know what they could’ve done as there almost didn’t seem possible at all to beat his army... It just felt.. off in a way. 

Pros: Now to the things I liked in regards to the story. I loved the way they showed the horror of the undead army. This episode more than any really showed why they were hyped up as a threat for so long. Seeing them push through the walls like a mindless hoard was horrifying, and I loved how they used dead characters from the episode to show how unbeatable and scary they were. Of course this created a problem with finishing the episode in a good way, but that’s another issue.

The best thing here was how they ended some characters stories. For side characters I think that both Edd and Dondarion died in a good way. Edd died unexpectedly and horribly, which was good to show the horrors of war(if we ignore that Sam pretty much made it happen), while Dondarion died fulfilling the purpose the lord of light wanted him to do. So overall a good end to these characters.

My favourites though were Jorah and Theon, in that order. After all Jorah went through, I think this was the end that suited his character the best. Tragically dying to protect the woman he’d sworn himself to during the entire show. These two characters have had many falling outs and problems with each other, but in the end Jorah died for his Dany. A good end for longtime character.

My absolute favourite however was Theon Greyjoy. Theon is a character that I’ve gone from kind of liking, to despising and finally to actually really loving. Out of most characters I honestly think that Theon has had the best character arc and journey in the entire show. Finally accepting his place in the world in the previous season, before making his way to winterfell, dying while protecting his family he’d fallen out with for so long. Honestly he might be one of my favourite characters in the show after his death. Massive credit to the writers for this.

Soon I’ll start the final 3 episodes(Cersei arc I guess). And while I’ve heard really bad thing about this part of the story(even the IMDb ratings are worse in ep 4-6), I’m hopeful that the show will end well.",[SPOILERS] Thoughts on the long night.

2045,gameofthrones,"This probably sounds like a stupid question but bear with me. I didn’t read the books and we didn’t get much context for how the seven kingdoms came together. If the iron throne ruler can out rule every house, then what is the point of being a king over your land? I suppose the iron throne ruler would be comparable to an emperor. How much power do the individual rulers have over their kingdoms? Is it sort of the way the United States functions, like there are federal laws and there are state laws, but can the iron throne leader overrule every single law of the individual kingdoms? What would be the point of ruling besides having wealth, if you live in one of the castles? When Ned has the letter of king Robert and gives it to Cersei, why are the nights more loyal to the lannisters than they are to the late king Robert and his brothers? Why was it so easy for Ned stark to get a death sentence, I assume it’s just sheer man power that gave Cersei the power to do this. Why are the castle guards more loyal to Cersei than the late Robert and the Baratheons. The patriarch family overrules the matriarch in this world. I’m guessing because of Tyson’s influence. Also, grey worm wanted Jon dead for killing the queen, this kind of loyalty seems like it should’ve upheld in kings landing so why didn’t they follow through with investigations. Why wasn’t there due process for Ned and Cersei on account of the kings death and his final will. Why was it so easy for the north to have varying degrees of allegiance to Jon but if you so much as joke about Joffrey, he can take your head? Is this just different ruling style and cultural variations? 

Sorry if my questions are naive. I’m just astounded at how easily Cersei takes power. I know she plays dirty but it’s like the greatest ruler of a northern kingdom doesn’t even get respect in kings landing. I know they have armies it it triggered civil war, I just don’t get why people didn’t take roberts will seriously",[spoilers] How do the Westeros laws work?

2055,gameofthrones,"Forgive me, I'm just a casual watcher. My friend got me started a year ago at the beginning of Season 6 and I only just recently went back and watched the first few seasons. I really liked 6-8, with all of the cool dragon fights and the really easy to follow dialogue and the excellent good-vs-evil dynamic, but these earlier seasons have a tendency to drag. I guess it's cool to see the backstory leading up to all the action, even if there's too much talking and you can't really tell who you're supposed to root for (did they even have a plan for Theon when they started? He's all over the place) but there's a lot of inconsistencies in the earlier seasons, and the biggest one that bugs me is that Jaime Lannister isn't king at the beginning of the series.

I mean, he killed the previous king. There's a clearcut rule established in the series. You kill the ruler, you become the ruler. Ramsay Bolton killed Roose and became Warden of the North. Alliser Thorne kills Jon Snow and becomes Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. Euron Greyjoy kills Balon and becomes king of the Iron Islands. Ellaria Sand kills Doran and becomes ruler of Dorne. Jon Snow more or less kills Ramsay Bolton and becomes King of the North.

So why did Jaime get shafted out of his rightful place as King of Westeros? He did everything right. He was obviously a corrupt and self-interested individual just like all the other usurpers from the later seasons, you'd think the minor lords would be tripping over themselves to install him as their ruler. Is it because he wasn't plainly insane? He didn't commit enough atrocities? Did they explain this in the books? I'm starting to wish I hadn't gone back to the beginning because this is ruining the later seasons for me.",[SPOILERS] Why wasn't Jaime Lannister king?

2142,gameofthrones,"This may seem off topic, but I assure you it isn’t. 

I was just rereading Nassim Taleb’s “The Black Swan.” When he started explaining The Lindy Effect I started to feel dread. (I think he also mentions this is Anti-fragile) 

He is explaining that if we pick any duration of time for something existing that we are in the middle of that duration. If a song has been #1 in the charts for 3 weeks, that if that’s the only information we have, that we can expect it to stay there for another 3 weeks. If we have been performing Hamlet for a little over 420 years, that we will still perform it for the next 420.

Here is the exact quote that got me:

“Let's say a project is expected to terminate in 79 days, the same expectation in days as the newborn female has in years. On the 79th day, if the project is not finished, it will be expected to take another 25 days to complete. But on the 90th day, if the project is still not completed, it should have about 58 days to go. On the 100th, it should have 89 days to go. On the 119th, it should have an extra 149 days. On day 600, if the project is not done, you will be expected to need an extra 1,590 days. As you see, the longer you wait, the longer you will be expected to wait.”

Is it just me, or does this relate a little to closely with our waiting for GRRM?",[NO SPOILERS] This made me uncomfortable.

Arya’s whole spear sequence? How are those zombz not shattered, but just bloody and ok to be re-animated? The trench? Jon was sitting by it the whole fucking time he was watching over Bran Flakes and could have easily been like hey I should light this.

I never thought the ep was perfect but each time I rewatch I just shake my head and laugh out loud. It’s visually stunning for the most part, and if you’re looking for a good time please visit your local dispensary or dealer (depending on where you live), partake of their goods, and watch all the battle eps.

2295,gameofthrones,"So it would have been great in season 8, the long night ep, to have had Arya speak to Jamie or Tyrion about Tywin, even that they chatted about Jamie learning to read etc. Or even later on Arya having a scene with Cersei (Arya could have been posing as a servant at King's landing) saying she spoke with Tywin etc.

At some point in the seasons they explained why Arya's face appeared on the faceless men. They can or cannot make copies of a face, living or dead?

I think David and Dan know how George R. R. Martin will end his books and made their Tv ending different so they would be no spoliers for book readers. Also that they secretly filmed episodes for season eight with the actual book ending. Which would explain why there was only six episodes filmed over two years when they were increasing production every year since 2011. After George releases the final book in tandem David and Dan release undisclosed episodes of season 8.",[SPOILERS] Game of Thrones including Season 8 with a twist. Plus my two cents.

Here's a [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/VNfPlMb.png) of Tyrion getting dragged under.  It looks like the Stone Man can easily get both arms around him and drag him under to drown-- or at the very least infect him with greyscale.  But he survives?  How?  

All we get is a POV of Tyrion opening his eyes like sleeping beauty, gazing upon Jorah his presumed savior.  But assuming Jorah handled all the other Stone Men attacking the boat, did he just jump into the water and manage to kill the submerged villain somehow?  I just don't see how.  

However Jorah did it, it would have been exciting and a very narrow escape!  Would have liked to see that...

My name is Walter and I'm currently working for a research agency; our team now works on a project **focusing on cross-cultural comparison in entertainment industry**, such as video games, TV shows, and movies. My job is to figure out **one of the sub-titles about how people in different cultures perceive the notion of 'Epic Fantasy'**, one of the most popular speculative concepts nowadays (and also my favorite) . So far I've collected thousands of responses from China and Japan but fewer in Europe and North America (too few to be statistically significant). 

**Now with the permission from the Moderators, I would like to ask your help to take part in this research by filling in the survey**. Pleas kindly find the survey link here:[https://survey.easebar.com/htmls/1dkg9l/paper.html](https://survey.easebar.com/htmls/1dkg9l/paper.html) 

The questionnaire consists of 22 questions at most and takes approximately 5-10 minutes to complete.  I am eager to hear what the 'fantasy fans' like me have to say. Your voice DO MATTERS and will be greatly appreciated.

**All questions are related to your opinions of  'Epic Fantasy' opinion and relative experience in TV shows, movies, fictions and video games ONLY**. We'll not collect any of your PI except for gender, age and occupation. Feel free to post any comment or question below and I'd be more than happy to answer them for you.

2386,gameofthrones,"So I haven’t watched many series, mostly just Star Wars and a few anime. I love fantasy, and knew the show existed (further pressed by the season 8 = bad memes last year). So watching this series blew me away with the depth of characters and how complex the stories were. I didn’t know a story could be this realistic and good, it set a new bar for me honestly. I thought about writing my own story with my own world, but I don’t know if I could ever write something that touches this series.

Seasons 1-4 (and to a lesser degree 5) were fantastic, and they’re what I’m talking about above. Seasons 6-7 were still great but not on that level. I already knew season 8 was supposed to be the most disappointing thing ever, so I was prepared from the start (and being a Star Wars fan, having high expectations for the sequels prior to the Disney acquisition, I’m used to disappointment lol). And it was pretty bad, the Night King was completely wasted and it should’ve been multiple episodes of battle with him. But besides the Night King, it was just acceptable if you expect it from the start and don’t dive into speculation/theories. I also appreciated the relatively happy ending. I was on edge the entire season 8 hoping Tyrion wasn’t killed. I was depressed for a week when they killed my guy Ned, hopeless after the Red Wedding, and almost sick when Shireen was burnt alive. I don’t think I could take it seeing Tyrion die lol

Favorite characters:
* Tyrion
* The Hound
* Robert (the realism of his backstory is crazy tho)
* Sam
* Jon Snow
* Tormund (“have I ever told you why people call me Giantsbane??”)
* Ned
* Arya 

And some questions I had:

* When the Night King was raising his hand in front of Bran, what was he going to do? Just grab his blade, or was he going to do something more interesting? I would’ve loved to see him talk to Bran as well, but Arya yeeted herself at him too early 

* Why did Sansa “free” the North? Bran is a Northman and a Stark as well, as much as Sansa, so why wouldn’t the North be safer with Bran ruling them as a united Kingdom?

 * Are seasons 6-8 really canon? If the Winds of Winter hasn’t even been released, Martin may revise portions of it (since he doesn’t feel it’s ready yet). So the finished product may be quite different than the HBO version. Is that how it’s viewed?

* What could “A Dream of Spring” even be about? There’s no more enemies to fight is there? Unless it’s related to the red priestess’ or the land Arya goes off to?

* In Fire and Blood, if Orys Baratheon is Aegon’s half-brother, does that mean the Baratheon’s have the blood of the dragon as well? Or was he a half brother on the non-Targaryen side?",[Spoilers] Just finished the series today

2424,gameofthrones,"What if, after Joffrey's death, Tywin accepted that Tyrion and not Jaime was his true heir, and avoided setting up that farce of a process in order to force Jaime to give up his Kingsguard position and become Lord of Casterly Rock?

We would have, for a moment, Tommen as King and Margaery as Queen (the kingdom could do worse). Jaime as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard and secret lover of the Queen Mother Cersei. Tyrion would be heir to Casterly Rock and husband to Sansa, set to become Lady of Casterly Rock. Myrcella would be bethroted to Trystane Martell, and Ellaria would have no reason to murder her because, you know, Oberyn would still be alive.
Most importantly, Tywin would be alive and working with Olenna Tyrell to prevent everyone from losing their shit (i.e. Cersei putting the kingdom in the hands of the Sparrows). His worst concern at this stage would be to find a way to convince Tyrion to break his vow of not sleeping with Sansa.

After the arranged marriages bore children, House Lannister would be solidly tied to all Great Houses (the Starks with Sansa, the Tyrell with Margaery, the Martell with Myrcella, and they would have a claim on house Baratheon through Tommen which was only challenged by Stannis, pretty much irrelevant at this point).

Westeros would be unified and under the firm grip of two strong leaders, Tywin and Olenna, and in an excellent position to repel Daenerys' invasion. Assuming they find a way to fight dragons which is doubtful. Also, later on the Night King would slaughter all.

What do you think? Could Tywin have it all, if he wasn't incapable of accepting Tyrion?",[Spoilers] Endgame for Tywin

2441,gameofthrones,"Well I am now watching Game of Thrones for a third time and many thoughts have come across my mind like ""Why didn't this happen"" or ""That was a dumb choice, you should've done this"" but then it wouldn't have been Game of Thrones, now would it.

However, the biggest one that struck my mind is why didn't he become king? He is a phenomenal leader, charismatic, noble (to many extents), a brilliant tactician for someone who has little military experience, and he cares for the common man. Not to mention, according to Varys, he plays the game well.

Granted, Game of Thrones is a very circular and ironic show and series. For instance, Starks have Winterfell, they lose Winterfell, then they get it back. Many elements of the show are somewhat predictable given you follow the patterns and everything that is done, has a consequence. Basically, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Frey kill Starks, Starks kill the Freys. AKA DON'T MESS WITH ARYA!

Now back to the topic, Tyrion Lannister would've been the best king seen. He cares for the common people, seen multiple times as he walks through Kings Landing without armed escorts (except Bron) and in Meereen where he walks the roads with Varys. He is a brilliant tactician for instance, the Blackwater Bay battle when he uses wildfire and then the secret passage to ward off invaders. He has a caring heart, which means he has the capacity to show mercy, but fury to his enemies and those who betray him, which is just what he said about dragons and their nature. For instance, he cares for Sansa but kills his father as his father has always been his enemy since birth, he just needed to play his cards and timing right. Truly his charisma knows no bounds and I shouldn't need to explain this aspect. He is capable of leading, sure he was a brilliant advisor to both Joffrey and Daenerys, but if we are honest, he was the one doing the most leading, while Joffrey tortured whores and kittens while Daenerys was caring for dragons and showing a caring and psychotic side of herself everywhere she went.

NOTE I am not an expert on the entire lore or history of the world and nor have I read the books as I have little time in my life right now to pick up books. I can't even finish a book I started 6 months ago, that I absolutely loved. Please let me know if you agree with me or think that you have a better option for who should've been king. Personally I wasn't a fan of the end of the last season and thought that Jon should've become king if anything, but that whole last season was a huge disappointment and felt very rushed.

Thanks for reading!","[SPOILERS] Tyrion Should've Become King, Here's Why"

Hey guys new to this subreddit and not the most knowledgeable GOT fan so this may be a dumb question but I always wondered how they measured distance in the show? Have been rewatching some old episodes and noticed at the start of season two Yoren describes the Wall as being “500 leagues” away. But then in S3E3 Jojen Reed tells Bran the sight can allow him to see things that are happening right now “thousands of miles” away.

2556,gameofthrones,"I've finally started watching game of thrones after many years of telling myself I would. Whenever I bring up game of thrones with a friend they always seem to bring up this 'red wedding' episode'. From what I can tell this seems to be GOT 'signature episode', like the Sopranos with Pine Barrens or the Chinese restaurant episode from Seinfeld. So yeah this post seems a bit pointless now but I just thought I'd record my thoughts before watching. I'm guessing the 'red wedding' is Joffery and Margaery's? Tyrion and Sansa just got married last episode so its either that or its Cersei's wedding. I've heard a lot of people die this episode, so I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this is maybe Joffery's final episode? Not sure if Sansa is going to stay alive much longer either.

Anyway I'm gonna know for sure in about 48 minutes, here we go!",[SPOILERS] About to watch the red wedding episode for the first time

2699,gameofthrones,"Mostly the same, but a few major changes. First off, after Jon and Sansa’s first scene at Winterfell, we have an additional scene in King’s Landing. We’re in the streets of Flea Bottom, Lannister men are patrolling, and two younger soldiers converse on the destruction of the Sept of Baelor and whether or not Cersei did it. We’re seeing this from the perspective of a few surviving members of the Faith Militant hiding behind the dilapidated houses of Flea Bottom and from the rooftops. These aren’t disgraced nobles; these are small folk with seemingly nothing to lose. The men on the rooftop are getting something ready, looking absolutely fucking terrified as they do.

Younger soldier: “The small folk hate her, you know. More so than they ever hated Tywin, or even the Imp. And the faith hated her even more. It makes sense…” 

\*older soldier glares at him, and he bows his head in a mixture of respect and fear\*

Older soldier: “Say she blew up the Sept. Not much to show for it, eh? Most of the great houses have abandoned her, and you’re right, the small folk despise her. And she doesn’t even have a damned child to show for it. Her time will come and go, sooner than you realize.”

The members of the Faith Militant on the rooftop reveal their secret weapon; they pour barrels and barrels of boiling water onto the Lannister men, and as some of the men scream in pain, they are ambushed and stabbed to death by the Faith Militant on the ground. The plan, however, goes awry, as some of the Lannister men are not as badly burned, and overpower and disarm the Faith. Before they kill all of the Faith Militant, their commander shouts to them “No. The Queen will want to have words with them.”

We cut to a small shack in Fleabottom, with a mother and her sleeping daughter. The door suddenly bursts open, and Lannister soldiers pour into the shack. The mother and daughter are shocked into consciousness, and they are grabbed by the soldiers and forced outside. Outside the two are shocked at the sight of dead bodies hanging from every building in sight, each one of their heads covered with a bag marked with the seven pointed star. As the mother looks in horror, she then screams as she and her daughter are separated. The Kingsguard drags her down to the dungeons, and she passes Septa Unella’s cell, just barely seeing her shaking, barely breathing body. We see Qyburn, the Mountain, and Cersei’s handmaiden eyeing her. The woman is thrown into a cell and chained to the floor. 

She hears a voice in the shadows, “An improvement, wouldn’t you say?” Queen Cersei Lannister emerges from the shadows, smiling at the woman. “Much less crowded than the streets of Flea Bottom, isn’t it?” The woman mutters, “Y-your grace, the Kingsguard they took my daughter, they...” “The Master of Whisperers needs eyes all over Westeros. Your daughter will be most useful. Of course, she’ll put up a fight, won’t she. Very spirited, your little girl. Even our Kingsguard had trouble taking her."" She pauses for a second. ""Of course she is her father’s daughter.” The woman is confused. “Bring him in.” Cersei says. The door opens, and the guards bring in one of the members of the Faith Militant. The woman looks in shock and horror, recognizing the man as her former lover. “I’ll say this. As long as your daughter cooperates, her mother will live.” The woman tries to hug the Faith Militant person, the guards pry her away as she starts to scream. 

Cersei looks at the man. “Oh course, you did attack sworn members of the Queensguard. The men you murdered, they were some of the last remaining Lannisters. Bastards of course, but Lannisters nevertheless. And of course, there must be consequences. Qyburn gags the Faith Militant member. “You’ll be getting quite comfortable with Lord Qyburn. He has a special talent for turning insolent and stupid men into good servants of the Crown.” \*camera points to the Mountain. “Mind you, the process will be extremely painful. But by the end of it, you will emerge stronger than ever before. And every thought you have, every semblance of rebellion or retribution, will disappear. Every memory you have of that little girl of yours, every ounce of joy, every smidgen of happiness you have, will cease to exist. You’ll be nothing. You’ll be no one. And you will serve your Queen.” The woman starts screaming. “Oh for fuck’s sake, gag her already.” Cersei’s handmaiden gags the woman. 

Cersei turns to the woman. “Listen to your lover. Qyburn needs you alive, or else that daughter of yours won’t be so easy to pacify. So you will live. But you won't sleep very well. The screams of your lover, you'll be getting quite used to them. You’ll hear his pleas for mercy, you’ll hear him beg the gods to kill him already. And you will know that if you or your daughter even think of doing anything resembling treason, the same thing will happen to both of you.” Cersei walks away as the woman is crying and the man is dragged to Qyburn’s lab. 

Then we get the scene with her and Jaime. It’s mostly the same, except Cersei also reassures Jaime about the Riverlands, saying the situation is being handled. She also says that she has already ordered an invasion of Highgarden. Jaime points out that if Dany decides to use her dragons, there’s not much they can do. Cersei says, “We do have one advantage. We have the people. Jamie ponders, “The people, what are you talking about?” Cersei says cryptically, “From what I’ve heard, the dragon queen sees herself more as a revolutionary than a monarch. A queen for the people.” Jaime says “What are you saying?” Cersei smiles and says cryptically, “The dragon queen says she loves the smallfolk. Let’s test that, shall we?” We’re cutting out the scene with Euron.

We also get the scene of the Hound and the Brotherhood in the Riverlands, except they find themselves in the middle of a skirmish between a few Lannister soldiers and the smallfolk. The soldiers start cutting down the smallfolk, but the Hound intervenes and kills all of the soldiers. One of them, with a seven pointed star carved into his head, asks the Brotherhood to come with them so their leader, Septa Joanna, can thank them personally. The Hound isn’t too enthusiastic, but the rest of the Brotherhood agree. They meet in a small inn, and are introduced to Septa Joanna, a middle aged, hard looking woman. She buys them drinks, and Hot Pie is there, serving them. After she gives her thanks and blessings to the Brotherhood, the Hound grows impatient. “The fuck are we doing here?” Septa Joanna explains that after the death of the Freys and the rise of Queen Cersei, she organized the faith militant in the Riverlands against the sparse Lannister forces. “So you want to bring the Tullys back into power?” 

“No. Lord Edmure, if you can even call him that, surrendered the Riverlands to the Lannisters. We’ve been fighting for months, and he’s done nothing to support us. And he’s still married to that Frey girl.”

“Then who rules?” Thoros asked. The camera pauses, and he starts laughing. “Don’t bloody tell me. You want the Riverlands for yourself.” Joanna smiles. “When I became a septa, I took a vow renouncing all lands and titles. Not that I ever had any to begin with; my mother and I work the fields like most in the hinterlands. Just look at the High Sparrow. A lying cunt to be sure, hiding behind the Seven Pointed Star and disgraced lords to justify his cruelty, but he never wore a crown or held a title. Because that’s not where his power lied. It lied with the Faith, and the smallfolk who followed it. So no, I don’t want the Riverlands. The people will choose a leader for themselves. But the smallfolk here, we’re finished with lords and ladies.” As that sinks in, the Hound sees someone sitting at another table. We see that it’s Arya Stark. He stares at her, relieved and shocked that she’s alive. Arya doesn’t see him. 

Dany arrives at Dragonstone just like in the show, except she gives a command for the Dothraki and Unsullied to ready their forces; they invade King’s Landing in a fortnight. Tyrion smiles. 

We get a scene of Tyrion facing the dragons, and petting Viserion, and Viserion nudges him affectionately. They’ve developed quite a bond, but Tyrion leaves Viserion when he goes back to eating burned sheep. 

We get a scene with a group of small folk praying in the morning; they’re trying to hold onto hope, when they hear funding on their doors telling them to evacuate. The small folk are then herded onto the streets; it’s a huge crowd, all of King’s landing to be exact. There’s fighting, but the Kingsguard is cruel, and herds all of the small folk in King’s Landing into the walls of the Red Keep. There are men and women screaming, begging for answers, children crying, separated from their mothers. When all of the smallfolk have been herded into the Red Keep, the entirety of the Kingsguard and entire battalions of the Lannister armies are blocking the entrances; nothing is coming in, nothing out. As the people are scared, the camera zooms out, and we see that the Red Keep is lined with thousands of spilled caches of wildfire, more than we’ve ever seen before. The episode ends.

Hope y'all like this, Im thinking of rewriting the entire season. Maybe some of y'all can help me with the dialogue. Let me know what you think.","[SPOILERS] Game of Thrones Season 7-8 Rewrite, episode 1: Dragonstone"

2718,gameofthrones,[removed],Ending Question - Jon Snow [spoilers]
2719,gameofthrones,"TLDR: This is long an rambley, but basically Theon and Daenerys' characters are much easier to understand, now that we've seen the full show.

\---------

Since I've been WFH I've been taking some time to rewatch some of my favorite shows. I'm on GOT now, mid-season 2 and it's really fascinating how much I missed the first time around watching it. It's also really striking--now that I've got a fuller picture--just how my feelings towards certain characters has changed, two in particular stick out the most: 

**Theon's guilt and internal conflict**

I had a lot more to say before I sat down to write this, but holy shit. Seeing his face contort into fear and desperation and ***horror*** at burning the farmer's boys was heart-wrenching. His character is one tragedy after another after another. People manipulating him to do their bidding, and all Theon really wanted was a place he could feel secure in. At the beginning of season 1 we think it's with the Starks. Then it's with the Greyjoys. Then it's to Ramsey as...Reek. And I'll admit that I was never a fan of his character until he redeemed himself towards the end of the show. He seemed overly pompous and brash yet uncomplicated. But...shit. His story is just so damn tragic and I'm just now understanding how fucked up his sense of self-worth was tied into family acceptance.

The thing that stood out to me most so far was Theon speaking to Bran in Bran's room. They'd just taken Winterfell. On my first watch I assumed Theon was just literally speaking down to Bran in sitting on his bed, his arrogance over the situation making him sound even more patronizing. I seriously hated his guts.

This time around I noticed the more sublte things. Like the way Theon's voice softened when he spoke to Bran. How he bent his neck and stretched out an arm. He looked comfortable, and he looked almost comforting.

While it may be argued it was manipulation, Theon's actions and self-loathing in later scenes only enhance this one particular conversation. Theon *pleading with Bran* yet trying to be firm and gentle.  In that moment he easily stepped back into the role of a pseudo-brother. The role he grew up in. 

**Danaerys' anger and hubris/The 13**

While I'm not a huge fan of the way her character quickly slid into a hot mess in season 8, her transition from season 1 (a young woman in love and finding her voice as a *queen*) to season 2 (VERY shouty and trying to please yet ready to fuck people up) is fascinating.

I was a huge Dany fan on my first watch, but somewhere half-way through her shouting and demands of fire and blood became tiresome. Her concern in later seasons of being just like the Mad King is fleeting, but there--yet that is where her road leads. I find it interesting that the story was once toted highly feministic due to her character (among others) and was quickly vilified as being a misogynistic nightmare by the end. 

I'm convinced that those people were watching a different show. How is she different from any other character that we've seen at war in the show? In GOT land, killing your enemies doesn't make you crazy; it just makes you a winner.

Season 2 has a sharp turn for Dany. She wants to save her people and she wants to meet her goals. To do that, she needs to convince a group of people that she's worth the cost they might have to pay. Her first course of action upon being denied access to the city is threats of fire and blood. In Season 1 we see her reborn in fire, and because of this and the birth of her dragons she feels invincible. These threats are repeated over and over. 

Her rising hubris is fascinating to watch because she--along with Cersei--are stark reminders that GRRM is not here to serve up feminist figures. He's here to tell a story. And in all stories women in power can be just as bad as men in their pursuit of what they want. Just because a woman fell from power, that does not somehow make the story anti-woman. Dany burning Kings Landing doesn't make her crazy.  It's where her story was always going, and you can really see her gaining some traction on that in season 2.

**The Thirteen (13) of Quarth**

My thoughts on the 13 are more brief, but the objections of them (losing out on the Lannister coin, not being willing to sacrifice 100 ships, etc.) **are all very reasonable objections**. My first watch I felt bad for Dany and annoyed that they would be giving her push-back. It doesn't help that the Spice King was an absolute prick upon first meeting Dany and Co. outside the gates, but at their core they aren't wrong to be doubtful.

Dany's conversation with the Spice King puts that in an uncomfortable light that we, as viewers, hadn't really considered. If GOT were a real universe, it makes sense that Dany's investors would want more than her word that ""her dreams come true"" to ensure a return on their investments. 

This conversation is a blaring foreshadowing of scenes in season 5, specifically Dany's exchanges with Hizdahr zo Loraq that led to some real (awkward) gems:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Your father crucified innocent children. My father spoke out against crucifying those children. He decried it as a criminal act, but was overruled. Is it a crime to answer one crime with another?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime. You'd be wise to remember that.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""So your reasons are true and theirs are false? They don't know their own minds, but you do?""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.”  
&gt;  
&gt; “At your command?”  
&gt;  
&gt; “If need be.”

Yet another unsettling reminder of how Dany's actions to us--through her eyes--seem righteous and fair. Yet through the eyes of the ""common person"" she interacts with, those actions have been sweeping, without nuanced, and cruel.

2725,gameofthrones," 

As the title says I just finished the books. I do not plan to watch the shows for various reasons. However, I've seen a good amount of Youtube clips and comparisons. Seems like the overall feel of the show is the same as the books but with some bigger changes. Seems to me like the last season was kinda a cluster as near as I can tell.

Spoilers - Please excuse my spelling of character names

Things that struck me as odd to which you have no inclination in the books. These aren't even covering character differences and this didn't happen at this time?

Stannis killing his daughter?

The dog and his brother fighting? (This is a maybe as Ser Gregor might be Robert Storm the new king's guard). But last you've heard from the dog is he was dead. Of course, RR Martin has a way of bringing people back.

Jon Snow and Drynaus? Umm they haven't meet, I guess they have a romance and he kills her?

The love interest between the Ser Lowerence Tyrell and Rynly? No mention of that in the book Rynly isn't on the small council Stannis is.

What's up with the super ""female power"" scene of Doran Mortell getting killed by his daughter? That I saw on Youtube? Did Marsella die as well? Way different in the books he's actually a cool character and seems to have a good head on his shoulders and brings the sand snakes into his plans.

Briean of Tarth runs into Sansa and Littlefinger in a bar?

Much more to talk about and much more I don't understand. Curious on you guys thoughts? Did you like the book or the show better, what other differences are there that you saw?",[Spoilers] Just finished the books have only watched youtube clips of the show.

This is a random thought but the scene where Daenerys makes Tyrion hand of the queen was such a great scene imo. Something that stood out to me in this scene is that while she names him the hand, she talks to him at eye level, letting him stand on the steps rather than looking down at him. It seems like an insignificant detail but I think it is important because for once in Tyrion’s life someone sees him for more than just a dwarf and let’s him stand tall. I remember times like the wedding when Joffrey takes away the chair to embarrass him and just think this is a great development for his character. It’s cool to see one of the characters who was always undermined by others make it so far.",[SPOILERS] Tyrion and Daenerys

2840,gameofthrones,"Final season (and the lead up to it) was hot garbage. But I will sometimes go back and re-watch Drogon burning the throne. Even though they totally shit on this scene after the fact, I thought it was a beautiful scene and some cool implications (that were of course never followed up on).

1. I just like the symmetry. The throne is forged in dragonfire by Balerion and then three hundred-whatever years later it's destroyed by one of his decedents. 
2. I also like the possible (though unrealized) thematic implications of the scene: That the true villain of this show, the only villain, is power itself. That humans having domination over other humans is the real evil, and this must be wiped out. Period. When I first saw it my thought was 'Holy shit, is GRRM and anarchist?!'

Now we can talk all day about anarchism (the political school of thought, not the idea of wanton destruction), and even though I am not an anarchist I would have been fine with, and loved this show for having the stones to be in favor of such an odd, radical, and underrepresented in media political leaning - aside from being something that the Joker is into).

I mean of course it makes it even more sad that they just shit all over this of course, but the scene is still nice to watch and think about in isolation.",[Spoilers] Something I liked at the end

Sansa did not fully grasp the situation her family was in when she went to Cersei and Ned was very brief with what he told her and was partially at fault for not telling her everything. While Robb was repeatedly told by Catelyn how dangerous Walder is yet he still broke their pact. Yet fans believe Sansa was some malicious bitch that turned on her family. Westeros was at peace during this time mostly. While Westeros was in the middle of the biggest war since Roberts Rebellion when Robb the king in the north decided to marry Talisa. This isint a Robb hate post I just see that they are equal in there actions of being blinded by love. Love is the death of family DUTY honour. Just my opinion. I know in the books Robbs cause is more sympathetic with Jeyne kinda raping him by being his carer in a position of power above him, him receiving the news of Bran and Rickons death and being emotionally unstable aswell him likely being under the effects of milk of the poppy that she administered not confirmed but possible.",[SPOILERS] Fans sexism towards Sansa compared to Robb.

2912,gameofthrones,Just finished all 8 season. Most people will not like what I'm gonna say so plz don't spread hate. I don't think the ending was worst. I think that the ending didn't reach the level of it's previous seasons. It was not good but I will give 5/10. I knew many spoilers from season 1 to season 6 but still I enjoyed it than most of the show. I had no idea about season 7 so I enjoyed it the most. From season 1 to 7 best show ever for me but last season ruined it. I think the writers became a little arrogant after achieving so much they made it look like some child fantasy. I was never into any show as much as GOT. I'm glad that I watched this show.  My friends used to say that it's universe is very large and it's very confusing. No it's not. For some new watchers if you are watching then it's not as complicated as others say. I was never confused in the show. The Witcher is more confusing than GOT. people don't hate me for not hating last season so much but it was not the worst ending it just did not reach GOT level. It was childish fantasy writing still one of my best show and plz tell me why they rushed in the last season. I read that HBO had money for further season so why only 6 episodes season ?,[NO SPOILERS] STILL ONE OF THE BEST SHOW

2965,gameofthrones,"Okay before downvoting me to oblivion or raging at me, please here me out.  
I think the series was falling from grace since season 5/6 and the fact that only a few members of the fanbase raised questions, gave D&amp;D an assurance. They believed that they live in this protective bubble of gambler's fallacy and whatever bullshit they create will set well with the fans.  


I personally think season 7 response can confirm this, the season had a few wholesome moments and that was the only redeeming quality the season had. It was rushed badly, Danny had practically unlocked fast travel. Tyrion was already pretty dumbed down. Heck, people were writing fan theories better than the 7th season (about how Bran got into the mad king's head to tell him to burn the walkers but Mad King ended up burning everyone).  Tyrion still made plans back then for Danny but what is the point of all those plans if they all keep falling apart. He tried to remove slavery but the plan backfired and they had to do it by force.   
He thought of attacking Casterly Rock from the sewer system (seems like a Battle of Blackwater rip off to me) and that backfired too. And we all know the infamous ""The dead are coming lets hide with the dead"" in season 8.  
Uncle Benjen was used poorly too. He could've been used a proof that the walkers exist and yet he was used just as a plot device for Jon's escape.   
Season 7  was still praised after all these flaws and many fans just wrote off how Danny made it past the wall from Dragonstone in mere minutes. This is just my personal opinion that if we had fought of earlier,we might have avoided the catastrophe of season 8 and D&amp;D (the guys who think a fantasy series shouldn't involve magic)",[SPOILERS] I believe it is partially the fans fault that we got a terrible finale

She advised Robb to marry one of the Frey girls. He didn’t. That’s a decision that gets them both killed and makes life a lot harder for Sansa and Jon for years.

She advised him not to behead his own men and instead send them home. He didn’t. Again, this comes back to haunt the Starks in later seasons.

Cat is flawed, but Robb is still easily the most stupid of the Stark family. His decision making proves that.",[SPOILERS] In defence of Cat

3020,gameofthrones,"First let me apologize for my formatting im on an android so bare with me. So I know that there is alot of controversy over the last and final season of game of thrones however I must admit out all of my fan theories on how I thought it would end ,I never really saw how it ended as being the route they would go. I personally thought Aria would have a far bigger role to play in the show down with cersei because she was on her list and she wanted to kill her sooo many times.bran even thought she might go to kinslanding verses coming home due to this desire to kill her. Also cersei's death was just lazy writing in my opinion.While I totally understand creative differences I think they missed a huge opportunity with cersei after all she was a villain and before the last season no one else did vengeance killings like game of thrones.Joffery, the twintowers,crasterskeep,lord Bolton even littlefinger were masterful deaths so why did cersei get a happy reunion with Jamie? It just didnt fit the show.Here is what I think should of happened...

I wouldn't of changed to terribly much because I don't want to be that person who says the whole final season was bad so I'm going to keep my edits minimal but more specifically to the season finale. Thats not say I would not of changed more but for arguments sake thats where I am focusing my efforts.

In the final episode when the hound and his brother Duke it out and cersei slinks off scene with her brother and then we watch the collapse of the citadel  I think a better way would of been to never have showed them dying. But instead of kept the rest the same and cersei simply vanish. Only to have her reappear at the end of the fight after all of the other events unfold and have her claim to be the Victor of it all. Hold a huge gathering and tell the people she defeated the mad queen and that they would start rebuilding. And that due to the condition of kingslanding she would be sailing to the Iron Bank and would be putting Bran in charge while she was gone which would of been out of character for her put follow it up with some unity bs and have her mention a better world for her baby. Everyone would be confused but bran would just sit there smiling and have bran tell her they will get everything she requires for her journey. GOT fans would of been confused  did bran worg into her to make her say this? other fans would be enraged that she won and so on either way emotions would of been engaged.

 Then as she boarded the ship to head west just have her stare out into the sea and have her just start saying arias list of people she wanted to die and end it with Cersei Lancaster, then have her sigh and have her say my list is finally complete as she turns and goes to her quarters below deck. Insinuating that it was never cersei since the battle and had been aria wearing her face the whole time. one last devilish twist to end the series on a high.",[SPOILERS] for the series finale.

3130,gameofthrones,"As the title says, though I mean no offense to the show or anyone who enjoys it, honestly. I’m a few episodes into season 2, and while I’m genuinely loving the show, I’m exhausted by the pervasive sexism and gratuitous sexual violence. I have no problem with graphic content or even the depiction of sexual violence, but the amount of misogynistic/voyeuristic decisions from a story and direction standpoint are beginning to take me out of it. I’m not gonna elaborate here on what misogyny means because my intention isn’t to rant on the show or argue with anyone, if you get me, you get me, if not, feel free to ignore.

I was pretty iffy with some of the things in season one, but I held on because I’ve been told by friends (and fans of the show) that not only do the seasons get better as they go on (until the end, obviously), but also that their female characters get more tasteful narrative treatment as their plots grow more central, that the superficial sex tones down and the show reflects tastes changing along with the mid 2010s etc. But so far season 2 has been giving me the same impression.

Is this all true? Or is the degradation of women just kind of part of the package with this show? Honestly no judgement one way or another, I just want to know for my own tastes.

At 1:18, Cersei says ""*ln the rare event that Robert leaves his whores for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed, l finish him off in other ways.*"" I leanred that 'finish him off in other ways' means she made him come with her hand or mouth. Correct? Why did she do that? And why does she say this to Ned? Is she trying to say she really loved Robert?

At 1:45, she says ""Then, that night he crawled on top of me, stinking of wine, and did what he did, **what little he could do**, and whispered in my ear, ""Lyanna."" What do the the bold letters mean?

At 2:25, she says ""*You should have taken the realm for yourself. Jaime told me about the day King's Landing fell. He was sitting in the lron Throne and you made him give it up. All you needed to do was climb the steps yourself. Such a sad mistake.*"" Can you elaborate this story? Or is there a link to the page where this story was described? I couldn't find anything about it. Is she saying Jaime tried to be the king, but Ned stopped it from happening in the past? And there was a chance Ned could become the King instead of Robert?

And in this same episode, Robert was injured while hunting a whild boar because he was drunk. Varys asked Barristan who gave the wine to the king. And Barristan says ""His squire, from the king's own skin."" What does he mean **king's own skin**??

And at the Wall, Samwell was asked by the commander if his family keeps the old gods, and Sam said  
""l was named **in the light of the Seven**, as my father was and his father before him.""

3158,gameofthrones,"I just finished watching Game of Thrones, and while I loved it, I feel that there are some bumps with regard to the story most particularly the sequence of the turn of events in the last season.

I can’t believe the writers dealt with the Night King first before Cersei. When they started introducing the White Walkers in early seasons, my main prediction for the finale of the series is that people of Westeros will resolve their difference specifically the Lannisters, Starks, Targayens, etc and they would unite to defeat the common enemy. But... they reserved the drama. Seriously, if Daenerys was just gonna fire up King’s Landing with her dragons, she could’ve done it on the first episode of Season 7. What’s with the wait?

They really treated Cersei as “THAT” villain who deserves to die on the last minute and, according to them, more threatening than the Night King?? 

Anyway, a great series. My favorite is Season 4. I honestly didn’t thought there would be a story to go with after the Red Wedding but I was verg wrong. It’s where the real story began.",[SPOILERS] Did they seriously resolve the story with the Night King and White Walkers first before the things in King’s Landing?

Ok, so I’m late to the party. I started and finished GoT within the last few months. I’m glad I joined the party. One thing about this show truly annoys me and that is the entire High Sparrow situation. He has a little army of religious extremist dweebs that go around murdering unsuspecting people. They crossed so many lines, so many times, yet everyone is hesitant to retaliate. 

LETS BE REAL

Margaery is incredible in every way. A little hormonal mess like Tommen would have stopped at nothing to send a very small chunk of his army (because that’s literally all it would take) to kill the high sparrow and his, groupies. This bullshit was dragged on for far too many episodes and in any logical situation they would have been slaughtered immediately. They also had his evil mother which doesn’t matter to us, but it does to Tommen. Sure he’s a little bitch boy, but he would’ve given the order because someone would have advised him to do so.

3186,gameofthrones,"I just rewatched Seasons 5, 6, &amp; 7 and realized that the Dorne storyline got more and more convoluted before simply vanishing into thin air. In S6 E1, Ellaria kills Myrcella before somehow pulling off a coup and deposing Prince Doran. But then, she and the Sand Snakes just disappear for the rest of the season. No follow-up to see how they're ruling. No reactions to the coup from other characters. Not even a mention of Dorne in the 8 episodes of S6 between E1 and E10. 

Ellaria, the Sand Snakes and Dorne just vanished until a single scene in S6 E10 when they were pulled out of the woodwork again to conveniently serve as one of Dany's Westerosi allies. Then, 3 episodes into S7, Ellaria and the Sand Snakes were captured and the Dornish army vanished again. No one heard a squeak from Dorne until a mysterious Martell cousin suddenly appeared, took control and inexplicably pledged his forces to Dany again in S8... 

So, where was this new Prince back when Ellaria took control of Dorne?? If there was another Martell heir to the Dornish throne beyond Trystane, why was that not addressed? Why did the new Prince pledge his forces to Dany? They made such a mess of the Dorne storyline and all the characters involved...",[Spoilers] What the fuck happened to the Dorne storyline?

3203,gameofthrones,"Overall, some of the best TV I have ever seen. The battle of the bastards, the Stark wedding...honestly, epic! As violent and gory as it was, I thoroughly enjoyed the character developments.

But what on earth happened in the final season?

I could not wait for the army of the dead and the NK battle but it was super messy. Unengaging to watch. Boring almost. The NK defeated in an instant. So anti climactic. No problems with Arya defeating him (explains her training), but the leap out of nowhere had me cringe/laugh during what should have been a serious and epic scene. The NK should have engaged in a long fight with Jon or Theon or Jorah or Dany or Jamie or all of the above. 

Also, after so many losses, the next episode they were all partying away. Where was the stillness and the grief post battle?

Dany going mad is a plot line I really liked but seriously, did I miss the signs? Seems she snapped in an instant. No build up to her going insane. Private scenes with her talking to herself, snapping at Jon, drinking more, losing it at meetings, starting to torture and murder innocents around her would have all helped.

I also did not feel the chemistry between Jon and Dany. Think they needed more time to fall in love. I do like him killing her in the end. And drogon burning the throne. 

Jamie all of a sudden up and leaving Brienne to be with Cersei? Having a realisation he ""hates everyone"" when his actions proved otherwise the past few seasons? Felt unnatural.

Also cringed when Bran was like 'what do you think I have come here for' like... ugh. I understand Bran being King, but the way he was elected was awkward. Tyrion just going from let us pick Jon to Bran and everyone following suit. Why didn't Grey Worm drag out Jon for the final meeting too? Why were the Unsullied all of a sudden calling the shots? Jon was sent to the Wall, could never marry (come on!) and the Unsullied were like cool ok thanks bye! and off they went someplace else. Why not bring Jon back then? 

I do like Jon leaving to go live with the wildlings. They were his soft spot and he wanted to be free. But wouldn't it made more sense if he was consulted, his claim to the throne discussed (how was it even relevant in the end us knowing he was a Targaryen!?) and him relinquishing his claim, giving it to Bran or something. This could have all been done even with Grey Worm present, Jon could have still been in chains?

If anyone has any answers. Will make me feel better as right now I just feel a sense of sadness as I was so into the show, but the direction and writing was just sloppy.",[SPOILERS] Season 8. Binged entire series in two weeks (as a novice) and need help in explaining the events of the last season

3245,gameofthrones,"So in season 4 Khaleesi decided to chain 2 of the dragons in a catacomb (1 had flown away) after 2 burning incidents. 

Then she decides to visit those 2 in s05 e01 when Daario Naharis tell her that she is no dragon queen without them

In her visit the dragons seem to have essentially doubled in size and were in still the same chains so i was wondering how did the chain strap readjust to the size of their neck?

Bcuz giving them food from a distance is one thing but I don't suppose any unsullied man or smith could go near them to make the alterations and they did show that Khaleesi visited them after a long time and they were pretty fiesty

Some hardworking folks have made a Discord server so people can put their original characters into the chaotic world of byzantine intrigue, conflict, and betrayal that has woven itself so tightly into our hearts.

The setting is after Robert's Rebellion and there are no canon characters so that creativity has the most free reign. You can be whoever and whatever you want to be as long as you respect the rules.

There are a few dedicated roleplayers, and the server has great potential, but we hope for and encourage people who love the story and who would make interesting stories themselves... people like you!

3299,gameofthrones,"Daenerys going nuts on kings landing was adequately developed in my opinion, the only improvement I would make would be to move Rhaegars death to the battle to provide a trigger.

You have to remember, she did quite often overly punish her people when they ""wronged"".  For example, her friend person who slept with one of the people who stole her dragons was locked in the vault to die a slow death, she did not even stop to ask if she had a choice in the matter.  She had her brother killed in one of the most grusomely painful sounding deaths imaginable (he was a, as bronn would say, cunt, but he really was not too different from her when you think about it, and it would seem the only reason she killed him was to take the throne for herself, she was just able to do it because he was a dick to her). Her first act on taking meereene was to crucify hundreds of nobles, not even stopping to think that some were perhaps against the slavery. Then her first thought on the sons of the harpy was to burn all the nobles alive.  Rather than just leave the dothraki, she just burns all the leaders to gain their power.  Time and time again, if you do not bend the knee you burn (such as with the tarleys).  You have to admit she was overly brutal way before kings landing even though at that point we just excused her as taking out the bad guys.

It was also well set up that without advisors to push her in the right direction and give her a slap on the wrist when she did something wrong, she may very well become her father, and then in season 8 she started with 5 advisors, one of which would support brutal action as such (grey worm), two of which die (Jorah and missendai), two who betray her (varys and maybe Tyrion, depends when she found out about him releasing jamie), and even if she did not know Tyrion betrayed her then he lost her trust by failing a few times anyway.

Then to add even more setup, earlier on Cersei lies and says she will help fight off the northern threat, and remember Tyrion was the one who relayed that knowledge, so now Tyrion is telling Danny that when the bells ring that means surrender, so she would not be illogical in assuming it is a trick, another of cerseis lies aided by her brother.  

Another thing well set up is that she has a very ""right and wrong"" mindset, varys says something about how as she wins, she becomes more certain she is chosen to be queen and the more certain she is right.  She felt it was ""right"" to burn down kings landing as it's people did not turn against Cersei in the same way the slaves had in meereene, so she considered these people her enemy, the people in the wrong.

Point out all you want that time a girl that was dropped at her feet, there are many explanations for a change in attitude.  First of all, there is the psychological effect of ""one death is a tragedy, a million is a statistic"".  Then there is the fact she was way above, she did not see the corpse of a dead child at her feet.  And then she was also in the belief that the people of kings landing were wrong to deny her the throne and not turn against Cersei, instead choosing to thank Cersei for her protection, and as is evidenced with the crucification of the nobles of meereene, she stereotypes a group of people into her enemy and thinks them equally guilty of a ""crime"" she believes they commited.  Then there is the fact that she herself expressed that she would be unable to rule through love, only through fear, and from a tactical standpoint, if this were 100% true, decimating kings landing would be a huge power grab for her, to compare this to another situation, tywins destruction of castamere was a huge source of power for him, nobody had the balls to betray his house after that and it was a huge reason for his rise to power, he ruled through fear rather than love, similarly to what daenerys would come to try and do, and it ironically got them killed in a similar manner as well, betrayed by a family member.

Season 8 definitely had its problems, but daeneryses arc is not one of them (in my opinion).

This is just my opinion and feel free to argue against it.  I know feelings against season 8 are high, and it is a very controversial topic, but please keep it civil.",[Spoilers]My thoughts on season season 8 daenerys arc

Death was always around the corner, a fact of life all embraced. Few were as pushed as Arryn Lannister, second son of the King, was. Cursed in body due to the sins of his mother, he bears the fear of death. Knowing he had no guarantee at life, Arryn searches for a way to live forever in the stories and mouths of men. To leave a mark lasting long after he dies. To never be forgotten.

That Jon Snow is the son of Lyanna and Rhaegar Targaryen cannot be meant to merely serve to restore Ned's character. Ned's dead baby. There is no payoff. It has to mean more.

Given the absence of Griff from GoT, the competing claims of Targaryen blood between the living heirs was only briefly touched on in GoT. As it has featured more in the books, I predict the following.  
Defeating the white walkers will unite much more of Westeros and I expect that Aegon aka ""Griff"" will ride Viserion and Jon will ride Rhaegal with Daenerys on Drogon.

Given the Martells alliance with the Targaryens, I expect that Arianne will play a role in supporting Aegon's claim to the Iron Throne and provide Dorne's support for his claim.

Tyrion will broker peace with the various factions, the Aegon/Dorne faction, the Jon/Daenerys faction, and the Lannister faction in order to defeat the white walkers.

Arya kills Cersei in the books. Leaving King's Landing begging for sane rule.

My prediction is that Jon and Daenerys return to Essos and rule there and leave Aegon and Arianne to rule Westeros with Tyrion as their hand.",[SPOILERS] Why ASOIAF will end differently from GoT

And now of the questions:

1) Considering Tywin ambitiousness, pragmatism and ruthlessness, how would he react to two complete strangers, popping out close to his house (I'm guessing he is in Casterly Rock before the start of the show).

Especially if said strangers are two elves (Dark Elf and High Elf)

2)How do you think the rest of the people of the Westeros will react to such strangers?
The rest of the Lannisters, the Starks, The Baretheons...

Okay, so I know that Robb Stark had to die to keep the show going. I knew that since Daenerys proved to be powerful, and since dark magic got involved too. This is my first time watching Game of Thrones and it’s become clear that the good guys always tend to die or suffer the most. But the wedding scene where Robb, Catelyn, and his wife to be die is just brutal! 

My thoughts on it are conflicted because at one hand it’s so so sad and disappointing. He was one of my favorites and I at least wanted to see him he united with his sisters once before he died and was shocked that the writers did that. 

On the other hand I think it was a brave but smart move by the writers. It was becoming more and more clear that he wasn’t going to be able to win, and I think the moment that him and his mom lie down they almost look relieved. Like they could finally rest, and that they both knew that he wasn’t going to win the war either way.

My god, I love this show and surprisingly from what I was told, DIDN'T HATE THE FINAL SEASON! Sure it was not the best but from what I heard it was gonna make me die inside. These are the critisms I have heard:

1. Daenerys going mad - This was a major twist that did come out of nowhere. I am unsure as to whether I would prefer this to be foreshadowed or like it was. Once she started murdering innocents I remembered all the things she has done, including burning the witch in season 1 that murdered Drogo (made sense but showed her ""mad side""). In season 2 when she ordered her dragons to kill the bald wizard dude (Pyat Pree), then proceeding to lock up the other guy (Xaro Xhoan Daxos) and the handmaiden sleeping with him (Doreah) in the vault, leaving them to starve to death, Xaro deserved it but Doreah I don't think did. Season 3 - burning the former owner of the Unsullied (deserved it but point stands) Season 4 - LITERALLY CRUCIFING ALL OF THE MASTERS IN MEREEN, MANY OF WHOM I AM SURE WERE INNOCENT! Season 5 - Murders one of the leaders of the great houses of Mereen. Season 6 - Burns a bunch of Khals alive. Then we arrive at Season 7 and 8 which is where her Madness REALLY starts to become apparent. Season 7 she executes Dickon Tarly for standing with his father, foreshadowing in Season 8 when she burned everyone in Kings Landing as she though that they all supported Cersei. Finally, executing Varys was one of the biggest red flags in the ENTIRE show. All I am saying is, is that the reason why this was so genius is because throughout the whole show she got us rooting for her, so much that I bought a Dany pop figure on the throne, and when she commits genocide you realise how obvious her madness was and how much it was foreshadowed.
2. Secondly, Arya killing the night king. People are complaining because her storyline was not intertwined with his at all, also because she came out of literally nowhere. I will also defend this decision. Arya killing the Night King was not only the perfect way to end her arch, but to make the Night King's death realistic. Firstly, the rest of the characters, Daenerys was busy with Jorah, Jon was busy with Visereon, and the only other character with a tie to him was Bran, that can pretty much rule out any of those characters. There was no organic way to get these characters to kill him. Arya, having just escaped that enormous horde of Wights was the perfect candidate to kill the Night King, also The Red Woman reminded of her ""destiny"", which was to ""shut many eyes, Brown *eyes*, *green eyes*, and *blue eyes"",* basically telling her to run to Bran and wait for the night king. She seeing what was about to happen slips past his army and kills him. Onto my second point, her slipping past. People complain about this as they think that it was unrealistic. Remember, Arya spent a little over 2 years in Bravos being taught how to fight, this would (I assume) include getting past people without being noticed, literally being ""no one"". One white walker did seem to notice her but by then it was too late. To summarise, Arya killing the Night King was realistic and brought her story arc, from multiple seasons (including when she met the Red Woman, becoming ""no one"" and her ascension into the badass we all know and love, going from firing arrows as a joke because girls can't use weapons, to defeating the most dangerous villain in the entire world really ties her ark in a nice bow.
3. Bran becoming the King of Westeros, PERFECT CANDIDATE! Bran is the 3 eyed raven, which means he can see into the future and the past, therefore making him the perfect judge of what is right and wrong. The entire theme of the final episode and what eventually drove Jon to killing Dany is her insisting that she knew what was right, even if it killed so many. Considering that Bran can see everything that ever happened, can ensure that the realm is in safe hands as he can learn from others mistakes.
4. Finally, I read that Bran revealing to Jon that he is a Targaryen becomes useless if John isn't king, this is simply not true. Remember, Bran can see into the future (as far as I am aware), which suggests that this includes many different futures as nothing is set in stone until it occurs, Bran would have seen Daenerys going mad, why is this important? If Bran hadn't revealed Jon's lineage, Dany never would have found out, which would have caused her to become queen (and not be killed) and she wouldn't have gone mad as her discovering that she had a contender to the throne caused her to see everyone as a threat. This could have lead to her going mad later during her reign, specifically towards her later life (like Aegon) and a repeat of the rebellion against the mad king, but this time against the mad Queen. Essentially, by revealing that Jon is a Targaryen, Bran broke the wheel, the endless cycle and essentially introduced democracy into Westeros (with help from Sam).

I would like to provide some of my personal praises from the season:

1. THE MUSIC! Oh my god the music was incredible, the only other show to give me Goosebumps like that is Doctor Who!
2. The death of the Night King, the way that it tricks you 3 times in the matter of 5 seconds is incredible. Brans gonna die, wait YES ARYA, wait shit, OH NO SHE DROPPED IT, YES SHE CAUGHT IT WOOOO
3. Lyanna Mormont, a legend, fighting till the very end and killing a GIANT. She was goddamn awesome.
4. Brienne of Tarth, another legend who thankfully didn't die (on the outside but she clearly did on the inside when Jaime left lol)
5. The way that this show messes with your brain and psychology is incredible.
6. The fact that all the underdogs had risen to the top or to the council. Bran, a boy who was pushed out of a tower and paralysed from the waist down, Tyrion Lannister constantly and called a derogatory term, ""the imp"", Grand Maester Sam Tarly who was constantly tormented for his weight, Ser Bronn who rose from nothing and was just a sell sword in the Vale, Ser Davos who rose from fleabottom and Brienne of Tarth who was constantly undermined and mocked.

Finally, the final season had flaws, what show doesn't? Cersei's death was underwhelming, but she was pregnant so we had to be careful not to turn the Starks (specifically Arya) into monsters (even though the Lannisters/Boltons did a similar thing with Talisa at the red wedding. The final season was a bit rushed but that didn't bother me that much. The Long Night had Jon as a sort of useless character who didn't do much. Also the Long Night was VERY dark, I suppose that the directors wanted us to watch it at night in order to emerge us in the story. Jon's fate was semi-disappointing, though I can't think of a better one, he wasn't a king, Sansa was Queen in the north, where else could he have gone? Also after Theon's death he wasn't mentioned, not once.

In summary, the final season of Game of Thrones is not as bad as people make it out to be, it was not as good as the first half of the show, but it was enjoyable and from a narrative standpoint was a satisfying end to a show. People were gonna be upset regardless as the writers cannot please everyone.",[SPOILERS] In defence of S8

3584,gameofthrones,"Theon is Jesus. He’s the son of God in Hell being crucified for the sins of humanity. Him killing those kids and committing his other sins represents him taking on responsibility for the sins of humanity. When he becomes Reek, he dies symbolically, and him becoming Theon again is his symbolic rebirth. He has two fathers. His biological father is God, and Ned Stark is his Earth father (or Ned and Catelyn could be Mary and Joseph in his story, that’s another possible interpretation). The line that the Ironborn always say is, “What is dead may never die, but rises again harder and stronger”, which is a reference to the death and rebirth of Jesus. In Theon’s story, Sansa represents all of the Starks, and what Ramsay does to her represents what Theon did to them. Him redeeming himself by saving her is significant because he redeems himself by saving the person who represents the people that he wronged. I have more meaning in Theon’s story than just this. If you want me to make a video explaining my interpretation of Theon’s story and post it online, please do what you can to make sure that this message is seen by as many people as possible, and please sponsor me by etransferring money to: gameofthronesfan9999@outlook.com

3666,gameofthrones,"Just started a TV podcast where my friend and I do deep-dives into our favourite shows. We just did one on Game of Thrones and we went really in-depth. Talked for almost 2 hours about all of our favourite episodes, moments and characters before getting into the last 2 seasons to explore what went wrong. Thought people on this sub might enjoy.

3685,gameofthrones,"I am kinda conflicted looking at this character.  He has not (that I am aware of) ever committed any huge atrocities, is a fairly honorable man (in a different sense than the starks), always pays his debts, and honestly does not seem like that bad of a guy (at times he seems pretty bad though).  Sure he is a bit ruthless and commanding, but sometimes that is a necessary trait for a leader.  It seems almost all of his evil deeds are in regards to how he treats Tyrion.  One thing I noticed is that he seems to be almost fatherly towards arya which is where most of my feelings of him being an alright person come from, but then on the other hand those moments may prove him even more evil than prove him good because he treats a random girl as his daughter almost and then greatly mistreats his own son because he is a dwarf.  Or is this still a good thing and he is tough on his children because he wants them to do well?  But then he tries to kill Tyrion (or not, I guess that is up for debate).  And even disregarding the killing part, then is his reason righteous?  Does he want them to be successful or does he want his legacy to be successful?  Idk, what are your thoughts on the character?

Oh, and this is only referring to the show version, but feel free to discuss book as well.",[Spoilers]thoughts on tywin

I’m working on my own graphic and want to be sure I’ve done the correct research to accurately portray it. It doesn’t even have to be number of times, it can be as abstract as: none, barely, often, raging alcoholic. Lol

I will welcome any input! And obviously will post final results once I’ve made the graphic!

Porn consumption has significantly increased over the past 20 years. It is a complex phenomenon in which there are multiple factors involved. Therefore, the scientific study of problematic pornography use (PPU) is crucial to develop prevention and intervention strategies. The study relates to PPU, religious and/or moral obsessions, personality traits, and maladaptive coping mechanisms. The study consists of a survey with 140 questions and I am looking participants who are at least 18 and has watched pornography before. Participation would be greatly appreciated. Also, I apologise in advance as this might be a sensitive matter for some of you, if you think that participation will cause discomfort, please do not complete the survey. 

Thanks in advance!

3952,gameofthrones,"Nothing earth shattering revealing here, but something cool I thought about more during a rewatch of season 2.  The scene occurs when Brianne is escorting Jamie to King's Landing and they come across some bodies of women who were hanged.  Brianne wants to do the right thing and bury then.

Then some Stark men come along.  They mock Brianne and joke about how they tortured one of the women.  They end up giving her no choice and she slices them up within seconds.  Jamie is shocked and said, ""those were Stark men"".   Brianne says ""I don't serve the Starks"".  


The scene is really interesting to me because here we see Stark men behaving just as shitty as Lannisters.  There are no heroes here.  With traditional story telling, we would just assume that all soldier men following a honorable king would be honorable themselves.  But in reality, Rob's army could have had plenty of murderers and rapists. Course we do see that later in season 3 with Locke and his men being real pieces of shit.    In Brianne's world,  her honor only has to do with whatever banner she pledges her service to protect.",[SPOILERS] Something New I Noticed in Season 2 Rewatch

3963,gameofthrones,"Every antagonist she meets is ridiculously supervillain-y. The wizard from the House of the Undying who can do a ton of illusions (including making doubles of himself) but immediately dies because a dragon breathes fire on him. You can make all of these illusions happen but you choose to have your original self stand directly in front of a dragon? What did you think would happen? And why was the place even called the ""House of the Undying""? And then she just leaves. It felt like they were trying to wrap up the story by the end of the episode by making the resolution as simple as possible.

Same deal with the slaver guy who owns the Unsullied. The writers made it so obvious that they were trying to make him the most despicable guy so that it would be satisfying for us to watch him die. And he sells his entire army to one person? What did you expect, my guy? It feels like everyone goes way too easy on her.

Also, just like a superhero, she's a massive hypocrite. She's disgusted by the slaver but still takes his army of slaves and uses it to kill him and probably kill thousands more while trying to retake the throne.",[SPOILERS] Daenerys' S3 story reads like a superhero cartoon.

3972,gameofthrones,"I watched the Battle of the Bastards and the Finale for the first time last night. GRRM and everyone at GOT proved their worth for the 🐐 show conversation.

The biggest moment I took from the former was Jon suffocating under the dead bodies of soldiers. These soldiers are men who he died for, the men who pledged to die for him, and men who pledged to kill him. Jon has always been one to take responsibility and put weight onto his shoulders. In the battle to win back his home, he fights to survive under the weight of his friends and enemies, the ones who made those honorable promises. It’s not a metaphor or an analogy because they put it right in front of our eyes. The pure depth of the scene is what’s genius. 

In the latter I noticed my one of my favorite parts of the series continuing its greatness. Throughout, the transitional storytelling has been impeccable. Many instances tonight displayed the continuance. Some examples:

Lord Varys to the Ladies of Dorne and Tyrell on possible allies for vengeance on the Lannisters: “Fire and blood.”
Cuts to Dany, who finally utilized her complete firepower to emancipate newly renamed Bay of Dragons. This unites the three most powerful Esos forces against the twins.

Little Finger and Sansa finally have the Talk. After the rejection, Baelish asks her who “the  North should rally behind, trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark born here at Winterfell, or a motherless bastard born in the south?“ Jon’s story has been a left a question unanswered thus far. 
Cuts to young Ned promising to care for the same motherless bastard a generation earlier. 
After revealing Jon’s true origins by revealing his deep brown eyes as a baby, brilliantly cuts to the same eyes in the present timeline. (My favorite such instance in the series thus far).

The scene opens with Theon Greyjoy looking up at the flag with his Ironborn sigil turned backwards, symbolizing how he was turned away from the Kraken by his father, Ramsey, and himself.
Cuts to Theon’s face and you can see the thoughfulness in his eyes. 
Cuts back to the flag flipping around, hopeful sunlight shining upon it as he rides west with the greatest army ever seen.

The finale also quickly and effectively wrapped  many important storylines, such as Arya “going home” and stopping at Riverrun on the way to check Walter Frey off her list. Everyone fighting for Dany gathers to her infinite fleet as she sails west for the Iron Throne. They were treated perfectly for a season finale, the former ending a story and the latter starting one. 

It goes without saying that everyone involved deserves each episode’s 9.9/10 rating on IMDB.",[Spoilers] My thoughts on the Battle of the Bastards and S6 Finale.

4009,gameofthrones,"I watched S1 to S8 the the last 4 days, had nothing to do with the lockdown.

S1 to S6 included was literally p e r f e c t, I cannot name a single thing that bugged me out or that I disliked. I liked the bad people, I liked the good people, the scenario, everything.

While watching S7 I thought it was good overall but actually the worst out of the 7 seasons I watched so far.

Then I watched S8... I have no words, how can the 6 first seasons be so well written, then ruined like that. It really takes intelligence to write something this good, how can it be the same man that wrote S7 and 8 I'm out of words.

My main issues are how the White Walkers, the big problematic built up since the beginning, the Great War, be resolved in a single episode... A single pathetic battle at Winterfell. How did it end ? Arya coming out of nowhere through the thousands enemies, one shotting the Night King and winning the Great War. Reality can be disappointing but this is a show, make the damn thing interesting...

And then Daenerys... I liked her character development in the beginning, it was really good, from innocence to slowly growing fiercer and fiercer, it made sense. But why does the character get so stupid as it goes on I don't get, and her entitlement to the throne and her ending insanity seems so far fetched, we don't see where it comes from really. To me her character is the main reason the ending was this bad.

Then comes Jon Snow... They basically ruined the two most important characters. In such a short span of time he became crazy in love with some girl he doesn't know anything about. Again, in the real world it happens, but this is a show, make it meaningful...

And we don't get why he lose all sense of reality in the end. Daenerys burned alive thousands of children and innocents, and was planning on genociding the whole 7 kingdoms, and he still wonders if she was right or wrong doing it ? Even after killing her ? He really looked pathetic, what a way to ruin such a character..

If you ever recommend this series to someone, tell him to stop at S7. I would be more happy having never watched it even if I'd die of curiosity, than die of disappointment.",[SPOILERS] Quick thoughts after finishing the series

4036,gameofthrones,"From the beginning when he seemed like one of the family and Rob threw out a comment ""its not your house"" and you could see the hurt on his face. To when hes by Robs side in the war, to almost sending a letter of warning to Rob. Then taking Winterfell, which again you can see on his face how conflicted he is at times with that choice. Then he stops the hunt for Bran and Rickon. These arent the actions of a man who is sure of the path he chose. 

When Theon is in the tunnel with Ramsey Bolton, before he realizes hes been tricked, hes talking of all the wrong choices he made, all to impress his father, he says one line that gave me hope for his characters redemption. ""My real father lost his head at Kings Landing"" hearing that brought tears to my eyes. He was so lost and so confused that he almost completely forgot who he was truly raised to be. 

Ramsey may have broken him for a time but I think when Sansa came back she helped him remember who his family truly was and where his loyalty should be. 

I feel like too many people just straight up hate on him, or think he was a coward. I believe after watching his brothers die, then his father giving him away, being taken to a strange place and raised by people so different from his own traumatized him a bit. And part of him stayed that scared confused boy for a long time. Again Sansa I believe played a huge role in healing that part of him. And he in turn helped her learn to trust people again. 

And in the end he leaves his blood sister to go fight for his true family at his real home, Winterfell. His last moments with Bran are hauntingly bitternsweet. Sansas tears as she places the wolf pin on his chest are heartbreaking. 

To sum up, cause boy I rambled, I think Theon Greyjoy is one of the most complicated characters on the show and deserves more appreciation than he gets.",[SPOILERS] Thoughts on Theon Greyjoy

4074,gameofthrones,"First time posting to this page, I am deeply obsessed with these novels. Its been about 6 months since I have read them and I do not really have anyone to discuss the events with but here I am. Once I watched the show I had to try and erase it from my head to continue to make sense of the books because if you have read them you know all of the plot the show writers missed out on. There are many other things to discuss and I am sure I will continue to post, I just want to know what everyone thinks about Skagos and what Rickon and Shaggydog are up to. I just dont see either of them dying like they did in the show and I think Rickon will serve a larger purpose in helping Bran or Jon Snow potentially. Also, do you guys think there is a Dragon on Skagos? From my POV, Dany’s Dragons are her Dragons and the route the show took he used Rhaegal as his steed until his demise. I think if Jon Snow were to ride a Dragon it would be a rogue Dragon just like his character. The other Aegon is going to steal one of Dany’s Dragons along with Euron. Tyrion saw a Dragon over Valyria and I do not think that this was Drogon because if I remember correctly Drogon returned from the north opposed to the south where Valyria is. I believe he will pass back through Valyria, claim the long lost Lannister sword, and claim this Dragon roaming Valyria as his own. I know this might be a stretch but I want to see if I am on to something. Let me know what you think and please critique with harshness if necessary😂",[SPOILERS] For those of you who have read the books... what are you thoughts/theories on Skagos?

4130,gameofthrones,"Why did it end the way it did? i’m terribly disappointed... why did the writers decide to have Jon kill Dany, then be locked up and sent to the nights watch instead of become King? They picked a character (Bran) who was passive for over half of the series with little spotlight until the final seasons, and even then he wasn’t in the spotlight as much as the others. We weren’t able to connect with Bran as much as other characters, it just felt so very wrong. 

in season 8, almost every character we wanted to be together, were together and in power. The ones we wanted to see fall, were falling. All signs pointed in a direction that seemed to be shaping up to be an amazing ending, then they broke everything apart and forced it in different directions.

So my bf has never seen GOT and The Crown and I had us watch it, because he knows nothing. 

We started off with The Crown and he wasn’t into it much, so I tried encouraging him with some spoilers. While the royal family was out hunting (season 1) I had said “WATCH NOW THE KING WILL DIE!”. But then he didn’t. He died in his bed later, which I thought was off because that’s not how I remembered it.

Anyway, a month later we started watching GOT and I suddenly realized I had fucking confused George VI, the father of Elizabeth, the actual queen of the UK, with Robert fucking Baratheon.

4341,gameofthrones," Disclaimer: I am only talking about GOT Cersei, not ASOIAF Cersei. She’s very different in the show; in the books she’s certifiably insane. 

I know this is quite the unpopular opinion, but I don’t actually think Cersei Lannister is evil. Sure, she’s a very selfish, vengeful, and power hungry woman. But evil is not the word to describe her. She’s one of the most complex and morally grey characters on the show, and there’s a lot to dive into. Cersei is the definition of being a product of her environment. Her mother died when she was young, so she was raised by Tywin who was not a nurturing father to say the least. In her adulthood, her three children and her father also died. We see her slowly become more and more power hungry as more and more bad things happen to her. 

There’s no doubt that Cersei is far from a good and honorable person, but I wouldn’t call her “evil”. She’s certainly no Joffrey or Ramsay. Arguably the worst thing Cersei ever did was blow up the Sept of Baelor. The Faith imprisoned her, tortured her, and humiliated her; The Queen Mother. She knew that if the High Sparrow would do that to her, he’d do it to everyone in power. She realized her mistake in granting The Faith power in King’s Landing. She even admitted it to Olenna. She wanted to take them down and she knew that something drastic and insane like destroying the Sept was the only way she’d be able to do that. But her true motivation was not the safety of the people of King’s Landing, it was revenge. She wanted revenge on the people who humiliated her and she’d stop at nothing to get it. Innocent people like Maragery, Mace, and Loras had to die for that to happen, but this is Westeros. Nearly every Lord has directly or indirectly caused innocent death for their house’s gain. I’m not saying that what Cersei did was entirely justified, because innocent death certainly isn't. But what she did made sense for the time they were living in. 

Besides destroying the Sept, Cersei did many other bad things. Ex. having Lady killed, wanting Tyrion dead, lying about sending her armies to the North, killing Robert, and making Ellaria watch her daughter die. That being said, Ellaria Sand murdered her only daughter and Robert horribly mistreated her. Though the Tyrion hate was not justified, that was just her being a bitch, and lying about sending her armies to the North was a stupid  and rash decision. Bottom line, everything she did, she had a good reason to do it. She knew what she had to do in order to win the game. She’d stop at nothing to protect herself, her children, and House Lannister. I think people who mindlessly watch the show just jump on the Cersei hate train and don’t really dive into the actual motivation and reasoning behind her actions. She’s a very deep, complex, and morally grey character. Not a psychopathic sadist.

4375,gameofthrones,"This post is just me dumping 4 full seasons worth of content, ideas, and grievances out so I can get it out my head. The reason I waited so long to watch the show is because I hate magic and goblins and spells and all that shit. I haven’t looked through the sub yet, don’t want to spoil the end of the show. 

They did the Stark family dirty from the beginning of the show till the end of season 4. 3 dead members and the rest spread to the win like dust on a windy day. I know they weren’t perfect, but I still liked them. 

Glad John Snow is still alive though, like that one, fights well. Shame about the red haired girl, liked her a lot too, wished they had stayed in that cave. I really like the full episode where they defended the wall! Hugely epic episode! 

Hated to see the old man Mourmound die. He went out like a champ though, fighting till the end. 

Surprised I like Mance Raider so much. 

Theon was a fool and I won’t say he deserved to have his cock chopped off, but he did deserve something for betraying the Starks. All the Iron Islanders, betray each other. Didn’t even fight for their prince, their honor bought and sold. 

Bolton and his bastard are terrible. Hope they get killed in a horrible way. Them and Walter? Wallder? Fray they killed Robb Stark and all his people for gold, those damn Lannisters! 

Not a huge fan of the dragon lady either. I know she wants to be a perfect ruler and that drive towards perfection can be irritating. She talks like she’s better than everyone she even dismisses Jorah, good man than one, shame to see him go. It’s her fault she got Aquaman killed. I liked Aquaman aka Declan Harp. Her and her dragons acting like she can control them. 

*Why did Robb Stark need ships? Why didn’t they just use the Kings Road to travel south? *

Not a huge fan of Stannis either, he isn’t a great man and he would have killed, Sir Devos aka Brick from Centurion on command of that red lady. He’ll be just as cruel as Joffrey if he becomes king. I hate that red chick too. Her and her false god of light, and wtf was that black thing she gave birth to?! Would like to see her head with that red hair get chopped off. Don’t like Stannis’s wife either she would have killed her own daughter. Also hope King Robert’s bastard comes back at some point. Maybe he will be a good king. 


*Why does the old man with the loud metal circles in King’s Landing pretend to have a crocked back?*


They fuckin killed Pedro Paschal, christ. I liked his character, I did not see that death coming at all. Truly shocked by that one. 

*And who the fuck are these two kids with Bran(kinda hate him too)?? This kid and his sister magically found Bran. Good thing he wasn’t still in Winterfell because he might not have left with them. And where tf did she learn to fight? I like that Bran can control animals, a cool power.*

Ariya Stark is a bit of a piece of crap too, couldn’t even give The Hound a fair death after he saved her life (I know he killed the butcher’s boy, but he saved her sister more than once). He saved her life too. Maybe he’s not dead, maybe he comes back, I hope so I kinda liked him. 

Glad Tierian got his revenge though, felt good. This means the evil queen gets free rein. Hate the queen character too. Vicious creator that one, she has no limits.

Final question what happened to the youngest Stark kid?? 

TL:DR -I really like show, I’ve watched four seasons in 6 days. I can see why so many people like the show.",[SPOILERS] Cannot trust anyone! My thoughts on season 1 through 4 as a new viewer

4391,gameofthrones,"I just finished GoT for the first time. I read the books over most of this year and watched the show starting a couple months ago. While the ending wasn’t good, I don’t think it was as bad as comments I’d seen made me think it would be. 

Here’s my final questions/thoughts now that I’ve seen the finale:

1) Why is Brienne a member of Bran’s Kingsguard? Wouldn’t it make more sense for her be be part of Sansa’s Queensguard (assuming she has one)?

2) I think I get why Drogon didn’t kill Jon (he’s a Targaryen), but why did Drogon focus on destroying the Iron Throne? Did Drogon understand what the throne was?

3) How did Sam become a Maester, let alone Grand Maester, so quickly? He hasn’t even forged a single chain link before stealing the books from the Citadel, and at the very end, he doesn’t even have a real chain. He shouldn’t be qualified to be a Grand Maester. How does that affect his family with Gilly?

4) So is there still a Night’s Watch? If so, isn’t Sam still sworn to them? If not, then how was Jon sentenced to rejoin them? If it was a lie to appease the Unsullied and everyone else knew Jon was just being sentenced to live among the Free Folk, why not just lie anyways and have Jon return to Winterfell once the Unsullied leave?

5) Why would Bran/Tyrion ever actually trust Bronn as the new Lord of Highgarden, let alone make him the Master of Coin? Bronn has given no indication that he’s loyal to anything other than coin, no matter how friendly he seems with Tyrion. 

6) Bran is still my least favorite character. By far.

7) I’m glad Pod got knighted and became a member of the Kingsguard. 

8) Maybe I’m reading too much into this one. But when Beric Dondarion died, Melisandre said something like “the Lord kept bringing him back because he still had something to do. Now that he’s done it, it’s time for him to die.” If that logic is true across the board, Jon was brought back to life because he still had something to do, and the fact he hasn’t died yet means he still hasn’t done the “thing”. 

7) Overall, I’m glad the show changed enough or left out stuff from the books that gives me hope the books will play out differently and have a better ending. Things like the Horn of Winter and Dragonbinder (Euron’s horn) and Lady Stoneheart and the Lord of Light being reborn could really change the ending of the books.

4450,gameofthrones,"PREFACE: this isn't an I hate season 8 post. I rather enjoyed it. Just asking some quandrys.

Anyway, so, the night king was stuck behind the wall.   And the three eyed raven was essentially stuck underground, protected. 

So, A, the old TER kept him from trying to escape? And second, bran going over the wall, back home, wouldn't that have lured him out?

Lastly, did dynaries dragon being commandeered, give them the only way out anyway? Seems like without the dragon, they'd be stuck still",[No spoilers] I'm confused on some things with the night king.

4453,gameofthrones,"I am curious to know what the most disappointing story line was that didn’t answered/finished? 

For instance...

* What voice did Varys hear in the fire when he was cut? Was it the Lord of the Light? Was he meant to be cut because he needed to only be focused on speaking for the realm/the citizens? 

* What happened to Howland Reed? Why didn’t he ever help out when the North needed him? He would’ve been the perfect one to tell Jon about his mother..etc. 

* Why did they need the nights watch when the Night King + Army are dead?

4666,gameofthrones,"I've never understood the High Sparrows ultimate goals from seasons 5 and 6 on the show. I understand (I think) that he wanted power, like everyone else on the show. He starts off seemingly doing Cersei's bidding in her game against the Tyrell's. However, as time goes on then he turns on her and inserts his dominance over her as well. Yet, he did not accept payoffs or bribes of any sort in order to satisfy his seemingly nefarious vindictiveness towards any of the royals or the powerful houses of Westeros. 

Did he simply enjoy watching people suffer - especially the highborn nobles he'd never been a part of? His overall 'faith' seems to be a sham, as he does eventually allow for Queen Margery to be set free sans her own 'walk of shame' in order to do so. Was he just searching for power then? It seems like he goes about this in a very strange manner if that was his ultimate goal. 

I would believe that his eventual influence and manipulation over Tommen, and his attempts to link the faith militant with the crown here, was his way of trying to ultimately assert his control over the kingdom; an allegory to how the Catholic faith had asserted its own power over the English monarch for centuries. I just found his journey here, how he managed everyone and the manner in which he proceeded, really strange .... it was an odd way to circumvent his opponents and insert himself into a position of power, if that was his original and ultimate goal here from the very start.",[Spoilers] What was the true goals and intentions of the High Sparrow?

Back then this scene generated talks about her possibly being a snitch, what I believe did not go through.
Even though, this scene still fells weird. I saw some news about D&amp;D wanting Davos to develop a crush on Missandei. Maybe it was a introduction of this?

Ps: I just realized I had not thought about GOT for a long time, this ending is so frustrating.

4808,gameofthrones,"I'm sure this has been talked about to death but here is my thoughts on it

1. WHY just send the dothraki into the darkness against 100,000 of the dead?? You're literally sending them out to die

They could have them inside the walls or hiding in the woods and have them charge mid battle

2. Why were the catapults only used once? You should be launching every single boulder you have at them. One after the after

3. Why weren't arrows used? They are effective on walkers aren't they? Fire arrows?

Same with the catapults, they should be firing hundreds of arrows constantly until the moment the dead hit them.

4. These 2 dragons could have probably wiped out half of that army before they even attacked winterfell.

Seriously, the dragons should have been one of the biggest weapons. When the dead were standing there / charging. These dragons should have been coming out lighting them up

ALSO they did build one trench and it did a good job of slowing them down

Why not build a few?? 

Why are you just letting 100'000 walkers just charge at you and nothing stopping them

Multiple trenches should have been built to slow them down

Now.... Before the dead even reach you they have to deal with

- Trenches on fire, slowing them down
- 30-50 boulders/Caterpults hitting them
- 100s of arrows
- 2 Dragons lightning them up

If the dead reach the castle and we are in a battle.... You now have a secret weapons.. thousands of dothrakis charging in.

Also... When the dead were climbing up the castle... Why is no one throwing Oil / Rocks / Arrows and stopping them? 

Literally all you need a few guys, tipping oil on them but instead you're just inviting them into the castle.

It's embarrassing that the show didn't think of these things because you have these kings / queen's / warriors / leaders / knights all in a room before the battle starts and they came up with the weakest battle plan ever made in the biggest battle of their lives.... Really stupid.

Any other good tactics they could have used?",[SPOILERS] S8 Ep3 Has the worst battle tactics in the history of battles

4878,gameofthrones,"I'm in the minority who (broadly) enjoyed S8. I think I enjoyed as much as is possible for an intelligent person to enjoy it. I fully acknowledge the flaws and would have liked to have seen an extra 2 or 3 episodes so it could all make a bit more sense. But we have to accept what we got and there are plenty of great moments, even if these moments hang on a slightly flimsy structure.

All that said, I don't think I've ever got so angry at a scripted TV series as when Rhaegal dies. That part is just so \*\*\*\*\*\*\* stupid that I almost want to switch off. It makes literally zero sense. How could Euron have had a line of sight to shoot Rhaegal without Rhaegal, Drogon or Daenerys seeing him... or his entire fleet? E4 is a mess in general which I'm sure played a large role in this dislike for the season overall, but this moment just takes the biscuit.

What frustrates me most (and this is an idea I've seen elsewhere a few times), is Rhaegal's death could have been saved for E5 as the final trigger that makes Dany flip. It wouldn't fix everything, but it could at least have made that enormous plot development feel slightly more logical.

End rant.",[SPOILERS] As someone who enjoyed S8...

I wanna read ASIOAF first but due to covid 19 theres barely any copies available in book shops and it'll be too late by the time I get them since my education is gonna intensify next year. Some of you might say to read an ebook but I'm really really slow with ebooks and its honestly not as fun as an actual paperback. So should I just watch GOT  first entirely or should be more patient and wait half a year to be able to read the books in peace. As I said before, I've already read the first book and I know its exactly to my liking, but I dont wanna wait so long to be able to read the rest of the books. Also, online ordering is not an option for now either since I'm practically broke right now (spent all my money on other books )

Again I'm very sorry for asking this question cuz I know alot of ppl are probably sick of it at this point. Any helpful responses would be greatly appreciated",[NO SPOILERS] Should I read ASOIAF first or watch GOT (already read the first book)

5036,gameofthrones,"Spoiler Warning!

Towards the end, when Drogon burns the Throne, i firmly believe that it was actually Bran controlling Drogon with his Worg abilities. He does this so that there us no longer a throne to fight over and they end up just needing someone to be a just rulwr and not playing the Game of Thrones, but rather someone who is deserving. It's almost 100% clear he knows the future as well so would know what he needs to do to make it happen. Like giving Arya the dagger because he knows she'll be there when the Night King is. He claims he doesn't want to be king but does this to ensure he is because he must be. When its discussed he says why do you think I came all this way. Then, when Tyrian (however its spelled) and the rest of the small council have their meeting, he asks about Drogon and proceeds to say perhaps he can find him, granted he could be referring to controlling Ravens and looking, but if he already has a connection with Drogon then could just re establish that connection again. Overall, even with Dragons being more intelligent than Humans, I don't see Drogon burning the throne when clearly he knows Jon killed Danarys, his instinct would be to kill his mothers murderer, not destroy the thing she wanted and what people fight over, he wouldn't care about that, just being with his mother. If anyone wants to discuss this, please do!

Personally, I enjoyed the ride.

Yes, the writing was sub par, and there are some questionable choices. But I simply enjoyed it. The mad queen angle was clearly foreshadowed.  I mean, has anyone seen a woman, a mother, when she loses her children? They become hysterical, crazy. And she lost 2, and her friends.
